	abstract = {Biofilm activities and their interactions with physical, chemical and biological processes are of great importance for a variety of ecosystem functions, impacting hydrogeomorphology, water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. Effective management of water bodies requires advancing our understanding of how flow influences biofilm-bound sediment and ecosystem processes and vice-versa. However, research on this triangle of flow-biofilm-sediment is still at its infancy. In this Review, we summarize the current state of the art and methodological approaches in the flow-biofilm-sediment research with an emphasis on biostabilization and fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone of lotic and lentic environments. Example studies of this three-way interaction across a range of spatial scales from cell (nm – µm) to patch scale (mm – dm) are highlighted in view of the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches. As a contribution to the review, we combine a literature survey with results of a pilot experiment that was conducted in the framework of a joint workshop to explore the feasibility of asking interdisciplinary questions. Further, within this workshop various observation and measuring approaches were tested and the quality of the achieved results was evaluated individually and in combination. Accordingly, the paper concludes by highlighting the following research challenges to be considered within the forthcoming years in the triangle of flow-biofilm-sediment: i) Establish a collaborative work among hydraulic and sedimentation engineers as well as ecologists to study mutual goals with appropriate methods. Perform realistic experimental studies to test hypotheses on flow-biofilm-sediment interactions as well as structural and mechanical characteristics of the bed. ii) Consider spatially varying characteristics of flow at the sediment-water interface. Utilize combinations of microsensors and non-intrusive optical methods, such as particle image velocimetry and laser scanner to elucidate the mechanism behind biofilm growth as well as mass and momentum flux exchanges between biofilm and water. Use molecular approaches (DNA, pigments, staining, microscopy) for sophisticated community analyses. Link varying flow regimes to microbial communities (and processes) and fine sediment properties to explore the role of key microbial players and functions in enhancing sediment stability (biostabilization). iii) Link laboratory-scale observations to larger scales relevant for management of water bodies. Conduct field experiments to better understand the complex effects of variable flow and sediment regimes on biostabilization. Employ scalable and informative observation techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging, particle tracking) that can support predictions on the functional aspects, such as metabolic activity, bed stability, nutrient fluxes under variable regimes of flow-biofilm-sediment.},

	abstract = {Intertidal marine systems are highly dynamic systems which are characterized by periodic fluctuations in environmental parameters. Microbial processes play critical roles in the remineralization of nutrients and primary production in intertidal systems. Many of the geochemical and biological processes which are mediated by microorganisms occur within microenvironments which can be measured over micrometer spatial scales. These processes are localized by cells within a matrix of extracellular polymeric secretions (EPS), collectively called a “microbial biofilm”. Recent examinations of intertidal systems by a range of investigators using new approaches show an abundance of biofilm communities. The purpose of this overview is to examine recent information concerning the roles of microbial biofilms in intertidal systems. The microbial biofilm is a common adaptation of natural bacteria and other microorganisms. In the fluctuating environments of intertidal systems, biofilms form protective microenvironments and may structure a range of microbial processes. The EPS matrix of biofilm forms sticky coatings on individual sediment particles and detrital surfaces, which act as a stabilizing anchor to buffer cells and their extracellular processes during the frequent physical stresses (e.g., changes in salinity and temperature, UV irradiation, dessication). EPS is an operational definition designed to encompass a range of large microbially-secreted molecules having widely varying physical and chemical properties, and a range of biological roles. Examinations of EPS using Raman and Fourier-transform infared spectroscopy, and atomic-force microscopy suggest that some EPS gels possess physical and chemical properties which may hasten the development of sharp geochemical gradients, and contribute a protective effect to cells. Biofilm polymers act as a sorptive sponge which binds and concentrates organic molecules and ions close to cells. Concurrently, the EPS appear to localize extracellular enzyme activities of bacteria, and hence contribute to the efficient biomineralization of organics. At larger spatial scales, the copious secretion of specific types of EPS by diatoms on the surfaces of intertidal mudflats may stabilize sediments against resuspension. Biofilms exert important roles in environmental- and public health processes occurring within intertidal systems. The sorptive properties of EPS effectively chelate toxic metals and other contaminants, which then act as an efficient trophic-transfer vehicle for the entry of contaminants into food webs. In the water column, biofilm microenvironments in suspended flocs may form a stabilizing refugia that enhances the survival and propagation of pathogenic (i.e., disease-causing) bacteria entering coastal waters from terrestrial and freshwater sources. The EPS matrix affords microbial cells a tremendous potential for resiliency during periods of stress, and may enhance the overall physiological activities of bacteria. It is emphasized here that the influences of small-scale microbial biofilms must be addressed in understanding larger-scale processes within intertidal systems.},

We perform a statistical analysis of this 3D trajectory using statistical tools developed in the field of turbulence and anomalous diffusion in natural sciences. We show that the walk belongs to “multifractal random walks”, characterized by a nonlinear moment scaling function for the distance versus time. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study of multifractal anomalous diffusion in natural sciences. We then propose a new type of stochastic process reproducing these multifractal scaling properties.

Several studies have investigated the spatial scale dependencies of NDVI and the relationship between NDVI and fractional vegetation cover, but without any consensus on the two issues. The objectives of this paper are to analyze the spatial scale dependencies of NDVI and to analyze the relationship between NDVI and fractional vegetation cover at different resolutions based on linear spectral mixing models. Our results show strong spatial scale dependencies of NDVI over heterogeneous surfaces, indicating that NDVI values at different resolutions may not be comparable. The nonlinearity of NDVI over partially vegetated surfaces becomes prominent with darker soil backgrounds and with presence of shadow. Thus, the NDVI may not be suitable to infer vegetation fraction because of its nonlinearity and scale effects. We found that the scaled difference vegetation index (SDVI), a scale-invariant index based on linear spectral mixing of red and near-infrared reflectances, is a more suitable and robust approach for retrieval of vegetation fraction with remote sensing data, particularly over heterogeneous surfaces. The proposed method was validated with experimental field data, but further validation at the satellite level would be needed.},

Analytical results showed that they are different in formulation and that two correction terms involving vegetation fraction and the differences of red and NIR reflectances between vegetation and soil background, are required to correct NDVIC to NDVIF. It suggested that for heterogeneous surfaces, spatial resolution has an important impact on the NDVI measurement and NDVI at different scales may not be comparable, particularly for partially vegetated surface with dark soil background.

Although the integrated use of multiple sensors improves the spatial and temporal quality of the data sets, area-averaged FVC values obtained using an LMM-based algorithm suffer from systematic biases caused by differences in the spatial resolutions of the sensors, known as scaling effects. The objective of this study is to investigate the scaling effects in area-averaged FVC values using analytical approaches by focusing on the monotonic behavior of the scaling effects as a function of the spatial resolution. The analysis was conducted based on a resolution transformation model introduced recently by the authors in the accompanying paper (Obata et al., 2012). The maximum value of the scaling effects present in FVC values was derived analytically and validated numerically. A series of derivations identified the error bounds (inherent uncertainties) of the averaged FVC values caused by the scaling effect. The results indicate a fundamental difference between the NDVI and the retrieved FVC from NDVI, which should be noted for accuracy improvement of long-term observation datasets.},

The model was based on the observation that the biofilm itself has a negligible inherent reflectance and can be described solely by the ratio between its apparent reflectance (RA) and background reflectance (RB), allowing a straightforward calculation of the absorption coefficient (α). This coefficient is directly related to pigment concentrations estimated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). To run the model, assess and extend the use of α, the background contribution is a critical step. This work shows that: (i) indices based on reflectance and absorption coefficient spectra derived from the optical model correctly identified the main microphytobenthos (MPB) groups covering a pixel; (ii) contrary to the RA index each new α index was insensitive to biomass variations; (iii) for each MPB group there was a significant linear relation between the biomass estimated by HPLC and α peak at 673 nm; (iv) indices based on α spectra were almost insensitive to mixing constraints at a subpixel level. Knowing the background reflectance contribution of MPB biofilms, α can therefore be used to map MPB algal composition and biomass at any scale from MPB synthetized in laboratory to intertidal mudflat airborne observations.},

Since 1/f noise may display scale-invariant behaviour, ecological phenomena whose spatial variability shows 1/f type scaling are susceptible to further characterization using fractals or multifractals. Here we use spectral analysis and multifractal techniques (generalized dimension spectrum) to investigate the spatial distribution of epilithic microphytobenthos (EMPB) on rocky intertidal surfaces. EMPB biomass was estimated from calibrated colour-infrared images that provided indirect measures of rock surface chlorophyll a concentration, along two 8-m and one 4-m long transects sampled in January and November 2012. Results highlighted a pattern of spectral coefficient close to or greater than one for EMPB biomass distribution and multifractal structures, that were consistent among transects, implying scale-invariance in the spatial distribution of EMPB. These outcomes can be interpreted as a result of the superimposition of several biotic and abiotic processes acting at multiple spatial scales. However, the scale-invariant nature of EMPB spatial patterns can also be considered a hallmark of self-organization, underlying the possible role of scale-dependent feedback in shaping EMPB biomass distribution.},

	abstract = {Studies from a wide variety of ecosystems indicate that primary producers may protect their environment against degrading processes such as erosion by water current or wind. Theoretical analyses showed that the dynamics of these systems are governed by positive feedback. We investigated the implications of a positive feedback between growth of benthic diatoms and erosion of silt in tidal flat systems. A simple mathematical model shows that alternate stable states may occur in systems with positive feedback between diatom growth and silt accumulation, particularly in sediments with intermediate bottom shear stress. High diatom cover, high silt content, and low levels of erosion characterize one state. The other state is dominated by erosion, and hence both diatom cover and silt content are low. In an experimental study, we tested the critical model assumption that the growth rate of diatoms increases with the silt content of the sediment. Net growth of diatoms was significantly higher on silt than on sandy sediment after nine days of incubation, supporting the premise that diatom–silt interactions are governed by positive feedback. Furthermore, we compared model predictions to data on the physical and biological properties of sediments of a tidal flat. In accordance with our model, the silt content of sediments with intermediate to high bottom shear stress showed a clear and significant bimodal distribution, which may reflect the existence of alternate stable states. At low bottom shear stress, silt content was better explained by a unimodal distribution, as was predicted by our model. Patterns in chlorophylla content were less clear. Nevertheless, chlorophylla content was best explained by a bimodal distribution at high bottom shear stress, and in two of the three periods at low bottom shear stress. Our study indicates that the positive feedback between enhanced production of diatoms and decreased erosion of sediment significantly affects the dynamics of intertidal flat systems.},

microphytobenthic organisms (diatoms and dinoflagellates) over 3 spatial scales: microscale (10 to 1000 cm2), mesoscale (1000 cm2 to 100 m2) and macroscale (100 to 10000 m2). Analyses of the data disclosed the
aggregated character of distribution on all spatial scales for the majority of dominating microalgal species and the existence of 2 orders of aggregation. The spatial structures formed by aggregates of the first and second orders are noticeably different
from each other in the degree of aggregation (Cassie Index of 0.5 and {\textgreater}2 on average, respectively), overlapping of species distributions (Pianka Index of 0.5 and 0.3 on average) and degree of similarity of species structure (Pianka Index of 0.9 and 0.5
on average). This indicates the existence of several structural associations on the studied intertidal sandflat which differed from each other in species composition and the character of spatial distribution of organisms. The studied community had a
highly complicated spatial structure. The presence of several orders of aggregation probably results from several main biotic (interspecies interaction) and abiotic (granulometric composition of sediments and emersion period during low tide) factors. The
degree of influence of these factors on the character of spatial distribution of microalgae is related to the selected spatial scale.},

	abstract = {This study characterizes the short-term influence of the sustained saturating irradiance encountered by the microphytobenthos inhabiting intertidal mudflats. The kinetics of photoinhibition in epipelic microalgae from intertidal mudflats were investigated in the laboratory. Previously isolated benthic microalgae were exposed to a saturating photon flux density (PFD) for periods ranging from 0 to 180 min; every 30 min, a photosynthesis-irradiance curve was established to quantify the effect of the saturating PFD on both parameters αB, the photosynthetic efficiency, and PmB, the photosynthetic capacity. The αB decreased from the beginning of light exposure until the end, whereas PmB first slightly increased and then diminished from 90 min exposure onward. It turned out that epipelic microphytobenthos undergoes photoinhibition after about 90 min of saturating PFD. The possible ecological consequences of these ecophysiological results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) are a key primary producer of intertidal mudflats. MPB face strong variability in incident irradiance during low tides. Despite photoprotection and photoacclimation, such variations can translate into the photoinhibition of MPB cells. This study explores the effect of photoinhibition on MPB primary production (PP) over a large and productive temperate mudflat (Brouage mudflat, NW France). We used a regional and high-resolution tri-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled to an MPB model with or without photoinhibition. Photoinhibition leads to a 20\% (−0.79 × t C) decrease of the simulated MPB PP over the entire mudflat. As the upper shore is exposed to light more frequently and longer than the lower shore, the decrease of MPB PP is higher on the upper shore (−29\%) than on the lower shore (−5\%). With the highest photosynthetically active radiation cumulated over the mudflat, the decrease of MPB PP due to photoinhibition is the highest during spring and spring tides (−22\% and −23\%, respectively). The model suggests MPB photoinhibition is sensitive to the photoacclimation status of MPB cells through the light saturation parameter. This first modeling attempt to account for MPB photoinhibition is highly constrained by our current theoretical knowledge and limitations on the MPB growth physiology, but it suggests that this process can have a substantial impact on the MPB PP. As such, assessing the MPB photosynthetic response to the highly variable environmental conditions that prevail in large and productive intertidal mudflats is a real challenge for quantifying MPB PP from a synoptic to inter-annual time scale.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis is a process that indicates the productivity of crops. The estimation of this variable can be achieved through methods based on mathematical models. Mathematical models are usually classified as empirical, mechanistic, and hybrid. To mathematically model photosynthesis, it is essential to know: the input/output variables and their units; the modeling to be used based on its classification (empirical, mechanistic, or hybrid); existing measurement methods and their invasiveness; the validation shapes and the plant species required for experimentation. Until now, a collection of such information in a single reference has not been found in the literature, so the objective of this manuscript is to analyze the most relevant mathematical models for the photosynthesis estimation and discuss their formulation, complexity, validation, number of samples, units of the input/output variables, and invasiveness in the estimation method. According to the state of the art reviewed here, 67\% of the photosynthesis measurement models are mechanistic, 13\% are empirical and 20\% hybrid. These models estimate gross photosynthesis, net photosynthesis, photosynthesis rate, biomass, or carbon assimilation. Therefore, this review provides an update on the state of research and mathematical modeling of photosynthesis.},

They are not only responsible for capturing solar energy to carry out photosynthesis, but also play a role in photoprotective processes and display antioxidant activity, all of which contribute to effective biomass and oxygen production. Diatoms are organisms of a distinct pigment composition, substantially different from that present in plants. Apart from light-harvesting pigments such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, and fucoxanthin, there is a group of photoprotective carotenoids which includes β-carotene and the xanthophylls, diatoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin, which are engaged in the xanthophyll cycle. Additionally, some intermediate products of biosynthetic pathways have been identified in diatoms as well as unusual pigments, e.g., marennine. Marine algae have become widely recognized as a source of unique bioactive compounds for potential industrial, pharmaceutical, and medical applications. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on diatom photosynthetic pigments complemented by some new insights regarding their physico-chemical properties, biological role, and biosynthetic pathways, as well as the regulation of pigment level in the cell, methods of purification, and significance in industries.},

	abstract = {In this study, the spatial distribution of two operationally defined extracellular carbohydrate fractions (water- and EDTA-extractable carbohydrates) were examined in three intertidal mudflats in Western Europe (Dollard, the Netherlands; Marennes, France; Humber, UK). The three mudflats were sampled along cross-shore transects and sediment cores were sliced to a depth of 5cm. In these mudflats, diatoms were the dominant component of the microphytobenthos. Carbohydrate content showed little variation with depth, but it varied along transects within each mudflat. Carbohydrate contents were also significantly different between the mudflats, and the carbohydrate contents of the stations within a mudflat grouped together resulting in separate clusters. This was also observed when the Marennes mudflat was investigated on a temporal scale. These results suggest that processes that act on the scale of whole mudflats determine the variations in extracellular carbohydrate contents. In the surface 0.5cm of the sediment, water-extractable carbohydrates showed a correlation with both chlorophyll a content and median grain size, while EDTA-extractable carbohydrates were only correlated with median grain size. Incubation experiments also showed the importance of microphytobenthos as a source of extracellular carbohydrate, especially when subjected to the light. Analyses of the monosaccharide distribution of the carbohydrate fractions revealed that the carbohydrate composition was largely similar between the areas investigated. Structurally, the carbohydrates found in these sediments seem to represent a biorefractory part of the freshly produced carbohydrates that remained after rapid degradation of the more labile component.},

	abstract = {Sediment Transport in Aquatic Environments is a book which covers a wide range of topics. The effective management of many aquatic environments, requires a detailed understanding of sediment dynamics. This has both environmental and economic implications, especially where there is any anthropogenic involvement. Numerical models are often the tool used for predicting the transport and fate of sediment movement in these situations, as they can estimate the various spatial and temporal fluxes. However, the physical sedimentary processes can vary quite considerably depending upon whether the local sediments are fully cohesive, non-cohesive, or a mixture of both types. For this reason for more than half a century, scientists, engineers, hydrologists and mathematicians have all been continuing to conduct research into the many aspects which influence sediment transport. These issues range from processes such as erosion and deposition to how sediment process observations can be applied in sediment transport modeling frameworks. This book reports the findings from recent research in applied sediment transport which has been conducted in a wide range of aquatic environments. The research was carried out by researchers who specialize in the transport of sediments and related issues. I highly recommend this textbook to both scientists and engineers who deal with sediment transport issues.},

	abstract = {The properties and behavior of intertidal marine sediments cannot be understood without taking their biology into account. Biological factors are important for the stability and erosion threshold of intertidal sediments as well as for sediment transport. In this paper I focus on intertidal sediments that are colonized and dominated by phototrophic microorganisms and their impact on the morphodynamics and sediment stabilization. The emphasis is on epipelic diatoms. These organisms exude copious amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that may contribute to the stability of the sediment by gluing and binding. I review the factors that lead to the development of such microphytobenthic communities and the processes that lead to the exudation of EPS and its fate in intertidal mudflats. Epipelic diatoms exude EPS partly as the result of unbalanced growth. Extraction of EPS from cultures of epipelic diatoms yields two operational fractions. While one fraction contains largely neutral EPS, which may serve as a carbon- and energy reserve for the organism, the other is acidic and more recalcitrant to degradation. The latter EPS fraction is therefore predominant in the muddy sediment and may be responsible for increasing the erosion threshold. However, since extracted EPS alone is incapable of increasing the erosion threshold, diatoms are apparently actively involved in the structuring of the biofilm matrix. Therefore, sediment stabilization cannot be attributed simply to EPS alone.},

Particle image acquisition, particle tracking techniques of Particle Image Velocimetry and Particle Tracking Velocimetry were utilized to analyze the changes of these properties. The experimental results indicate that the size gradation, the drag force exerted on bio-particles, and the settling velocity of bio-particles underwent significant change due to the growth of biofilm onto the sediment surface. The study proposes a characteristic particle size formula and a bio-particle settling velocity formula based on the regression of experiment results, that the settling velocity is only 50\% to 60\% as the single particle which has the same diameter and density. However, biofilm growth causes large particle which the settling velocities are approximately 10 times larger than that of primary particles.

The effect of biofilm on the rheological properties of cohesive sediment was investigated experimentally. The rheological properties of sediment slurries with and without biofilm at different growth phases were measured and compared. Measurement showed biofilm growth has a significant effect on the rheological properties of cohesive sediment.

Traditionally, the referred study has largely been devoted to forming mechanism, influencing factors and physicochemical sediment conditions of all kinds of organic-flocculation and inorganic-flocculation. However, during the last decade, the bioflocculation of sediment by biological activity has been given increasing attention. But most studies have focused on the interrelations between biological and sedimentological variables. With the assistance of a newly developed field kit and correlative microscopy (which includes environmental scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy), this article begins to bridge the resolution gap between sediment particles and biological activities as well as its metabolic products biofilm, in order to better understand the role of polymeric material biofilm in floc ultrastructure and outward floc behavior of bioflocculation sediment. Results have demonstrated that bioflocculation sediment was observed to be composed of complex networks of biofilm and appeared to be of complicated physical floc structures. The biofilm was found to embed particles and permeate the void space, representing the dominant physical bridging mechanism of the flocs and contributed to the extensive surface area, architecture characteristics, and mechanical properties of bioflocculation sediment.

With global monitoring from space, as well as the continuation of traditional observations in the field, advances are being made in research and applications which use these data.

Sentinel2 imagery was then coupled with ecophysiological modeling to analyze the influence of tide-driven chl a and SPM dynamics on oyster clearance and chl consumption rates. Within the studied oyster farming site (Bourgneuf Bay along the French Atlantic coast), chl consumption rate mirrored the changes in chl a concentration during neap tides, whereas oyster clearance and chl consumption rates were both negatively impacted by high SPM concentration during spring tides.},

	abstract = {Estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla in mgm−3) in optically complex waters using remote sensing is difficult because traditional empirical (e.g., OCx blue/green band ratios) or semi-analytical algorithms (e.g., GSM or QAA) rely on blue–green wavelengths where water constituents other than phytoplankton often dominate the optical properties and satellite-derived reflectance in these wavelengths often contains substantial uncertainties. Some recent attempts have been made to derive Chla based on red and near-infrared wavelengths to avoid such problems. Using in situ data collected from 9 cruises between 1998 and 2010 in Tampa Bay, a large estuary ({\textasciitilde}1000km2) located in Florida (U.S.A.), we first tested three Chla algorithms, where each algorithm derived Chla as a function of independent variable x=Rrs(λ2)/Rrs(λ1), x=[Rrs(λ1)−1−Rrs(λ2)−1]∗Rrs(λ3), and x=[Rrs(λ1)−1−Rrs(λ2)−1]/[Rrs(λ4)−1−Rrs(λ3)−1], respectively. Here Rrs(λ) is the remote sensing reflectance, λ is the wavelength from 660 to 760nm, and the positions of the these wavelengths were determined using an objective method while the functional forms of Chla=f(x) were determined through regression between Chla and x. A synthetic chlorophyll index (SCI) using 4 green-red MERIS wavelengths was also tested. Using field measured Rrs(λ) data, all these algorithms showed the potentials to retrieve Chla between {\textasciitilde}2 and {\textasciitilde}80mgm−3, with 2-band algorithms showing the best performance. However, when satellite-derived Rrs(λ) data were used, none of the four algorithms was applicable to MODIS in this estuary, and only a 2-band algorithm in the form of Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) was applicable to MERIS, with other algorithms significantly degraded. The coefficients of the 2-band algorithm for MERIS were determined through regression between in situ Chla and MERIS-derived Rrs(709)/Rrs(665), with the final form of Chla=10.55x1.51. The algorithm yielded mean relative errors of 35.3\% for Chla between 1.0 and 30.0mgm−3 when an in situ dataset from the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) was used to tune the algorithm coefficients, which was further validated using another independent dataset. Spatial Chla patterns derived from MERIS for both low and high concentrations also showed reasonable agreement with in situ measurements. In contrast, 3-band and 4-band algorithms yielded significant patchiness in spatial patterns that differed from in situ measurements. Tests in Chesapeake Bay (located on the east coast of the U.S.A.) showed reasonable spatial patterns of Chla using the Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) approach, with a mean relative error of 34.7\% for Chla ranging between 1.6 and 21.5mgm−3, suggesting that the approach may be generally applicable to other turbid estuaries once algorithm coefficients are adjusted using local data.},

	abstract = {A new fast mapping approach based on an optical model was developed and applied to hyperspectral airborne HySpex images of Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). The aims were (1) to discriminate diatom biofilms (from the Bacillariophyceae class) constituting microphytobenthos on any mudflat and (2) to estimate their biomass expressed in mgChla·m−2 by remote sensing of poorly accessible mudflats. Due to the distinct absorption peaks of certain pigments of different microalgae classes constituting microphytobenthos, the high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images was employed in order to detect the pigment assemblage characterizing diatom biofilms. Thus, the HySpex 1600 VNIR camera was used both in the laboratory for estimating biomass under controlled conditions and in an airborne setting. 1) The mapping approach used known spectral indices (NDVI and MPBI) and new ones (IDiatom and IEuglenid) to characterize quickly the key pigments of two main microphytobenthos classes, for a fast selection of diatom and euglenid biofilms by two different masks. 2) The inherent spectral properties of biofilms in the 700–900nm range were also used to calculate an original estimate of the substrate/environmental effects in each mask. 3) Biomass quantification of the diatom biofilms was finally performed by application of the microphytobenthos optical model (MPBOM). This approach was first tested on laboratory HySpex images of synthetic biofilms for which the in vitro biomass measurements by chromatography (HPLC) were available. The comparison between estimated and measured biomass values showed the reliability of the mapping approach for biomass estimation. Finally, a map of diatom biomass was obtained at the scale of the entire Bourgneuf Bay. The range of biomass variation (0–35mgChla·m−2) was in close agreement with the biomass maps presented in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Estuarine intertidal sediments are colonized by photosynthetic microorganisms grouped under the generic term of microphytobenthos (MPB). These microbial assemblages form transient biofilms at the sediment surface and have important ecosystem functions. MPB biofilms are well known to exhibit high microscale patchiness whereas meso- and macroscale spatio-temporal structures are little known. In this work, satellite remote sensing was used to map MPB assemblages at such scales. MPB interannual distribution was investigated in the poly- and mesohaline domain of the north-European estuary (Loire estuary), using a multispectral SPOT image time series (1991–2009). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from two SPOT channels, XS2 and XS3, (red and near-infrared wavelengths, respectively). MPB biofilms were identified by NDVI values between 0 and 0.3. At the scale of the whole intertidal area, the results showed that MPB biofilms in the Loire estuary exhibited perennial structures in both the polyhaline and mesohaline sectors, occupying nearly 90\% of the mudflat surfaces. MPB biofilm density was closely associated with intertidal position, with thicker biofilms developing mostly in the upper and middle shore, and formed kilometric longitudinal structures parallel to the shoreline. Mean NDVI values showed a strong positive correlation with mean seasonal air temperature (τ = 0.714, p {\textless} 0.05 in the polyhaline domain and τ = 0.810, p {\textless} 0.05 in the mesohaline domain), with a strong correlation in the upper intertidal mudflat (between +3 and 4 m isobaths). Negative wind effect was mainly detected in the upper intertidal areas, particularly between the +3 and 4 m isobaths (τ = −0.810, p {\textless} 0.05 in the polyhaline domain and τ = −0.910 in the mesohaline).},

	abstract = {Polarimetry is one of the most promising types of remote sensing for improved characterization of atmospheric aerosol. Indeed, aerosol particles constitute a highly variable atmospheric component characterized by a large number of parameters describing particle sizes, morphologies (including shape and internal structure), absorption and scattering properties, amounts, horizontal and vertical distribution, etc. Reliable monitoring of all these parameters is very challenging, and therefore the aerosol effects on climate and environment are considered to be among the most uncertain factors in climate and environmental research. In this regard, observations that provide both the angular distribution of the scattered atmospheric radiation as well as its polarization state at multiple wavelengths covering the UV–SWIR spectral range carry substantial implicit information on the atmospheric composition. Therefore, high expectations in improving aerosol characterization are associated with detailed passive photopolarimetric observations. The critical need to use space-borne polarimetry for global accurate monitoring of detailed aerosol properties was first articulated in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By now, several orbital instruments have already provided polarization observations from space, and a number of advanced missions are scheduled for launch in the coming years by international and national space agencies. The first and most extensive record of polarimetric imagery was provided by POLDER-I, POLDER-II, and POLDER/PARASOL multi-angle multi-spectral polarization sensors. Polarimetric observations with the POLDER-like design intended for collecting extensive multi-angular multi-spectral measurements will be provided by several instruments, such as the MAI/TG-2, CAPI/TanSat, and DPC/GF-5 sensors recently launched by the Chinese Space Agency. Instruments such as the 3MI/MetOp-SG, MAIA, SpexOne and HARP2 on PACE, POSP, SMAC, PCF, DPC–Lidar, ScanPol and MSIP/Aerosol-UA, MAP/Copernicus CO2 Monitoring, etc. are planned to be launched by different space agencies in the coming decade. The concepts of these future instruments, their technical designs, and the accompanying algorithm development have been tested intensively and analyzed using diverse airborne prototypes. Certain polarimetric capabilities have also been implemented in such satellite sensors as GOME-2/MetOp and SGLI/GCOM-C. A number of aerosol retrieval products have been developed based on the available measurements and successfully used for different scientific applications. However, the completeness and accuracy of aerosol data operationally derived from polarimetry do not yet appear to have reached the accuracy levels implied by theoretical sensitivity studies that analyzed the potential information content of satellite polarimetry. As a result, the dataset provided by MODIS is still most frequently used by the scientific community, yet this sensor has neither polarimetric nor multi-angular capabilities. Admittedly polarimetric multi-angular observations are highly complex and have extra sensitivities to aerosol particle morphology, vertical variability of aerosol properties, polarization of surface reflectance, etc. As such, they necessitate state-of-the-art forward modeling based on first-principles physics which remains rare, and conventional retrieval approaches based on look-up tables turn out to be unsuitable to fully exploit the information implicit in the measurements. Several new-generation retrieval approaches have recently been proposed to address these challenges. These methods use improved forward modeling of atmospheric (polarized) radiances and implement a search in the continuous space of solutions using rigorous statistically optimized inversions. Such techniques provide more accurate retrievals of the main aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness and yield additional parameters such as aerosol absorption. However, the operational implementation of advanced retrieval approaches generally requires a significant extra effort, and the forward-modeling part of such retrievals still needs to be substantially improved. Ground-based passive polarimetric measurements have also been evolving over the past decade. Although polarimetry helps improve aerosol characterization, especially of the fine aerosol mode, the operators of major observational networks such as AERONET remain reluctant to include polarimetric measurements as part of routine retrievals owing to their high complexity and notable increase in effort required to acquire and interpret polarization data. In addition to remote-sensing observations, polarimetric characteristics of aerosol scattering have been measured in situ as well as in the laboratory using polar nephelometers. Such measurements constitute direct observations of single scattering with no contributions from multiple scattering effects and therefore provide unique data for the validation of aerosol optical models and retrieval concepts. This article overviews the above-mentioned polarimetric observations, their history and expected developments, and the state of resulting aerosol products. It also discusses the main achievements and challenges in the exploitation of polarimetry for the improved characterization of atmospheric aerosols.},

	abstract = {The accurate measurement of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in coastal waters is of crucial importance for ecosystem studies, sediment transport monitoring, and assessment of anthropogenic impacts in the coastal ocean. Ocean color remote sensing is an efficient tool to monitor SPM spatio-temporal variability in coastal waters. However, near-shore satellite images are complex to correct for atmospheric effects due to the proximity of land and to the high level of reflectance caused by high SPM concentrations in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The water reflectance signal (ρw) tends to saturate at short visible wavelengths when the SPM concentration increases. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ SPM and water reflectance data, this study presents (i) an assessment of existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms developed for turbid coastal waters; and (ii) a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive SPM vs. ρw relationship, to avoid saturation effects when computing the SPM concentration. The approach is applied to satellite data acquired by three medium-high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) to map the SPM concentration in some of the most turbid areas of the European coastal ocean, namely the Gironde and Loire estuaries as well as Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. For all three sensors, AC methods based on the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands were tested, and the consistency of the retrieved water reflectance was examined along transects from low- to high-turbidity waters. For OLI data, we also compared a SWIR-based AC (ACOLITE) with a method based on multi-temporal analyses of atmospheric constituents (MACCS). For the selected scenes, the ACOLITE-MACCS difference was lower than 7\%. Despite some inaccuracies in ρw retrieval, we demonstrate that the SPM concentration can be reliably estimated using OLI, MODIS and VIIRS, regardless of their differences in spatial and spectral resolutions. Match-ups between the OLI-derived SPM concentration and autonomous field measurements from the Loire and Gironde estuaries’ monitoring networks provided satisfactory results. The multi-sensor approach together with the multi-conditional algorithm presented here can be applied to the latest generation of ocean color sensors (namely Sentinel2/MSI and Sentinel3/OLCI) to study SPM dynamics in the coastal ocean at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.},

Slope is separated into steep slope {\textgreater}0.04, and low slope {\textless}0.04, with a further possible category of very steep slope (∼0.16). Further analysis of meso and macrotidal mudflats (tidal ranges 2–6m) revealed additional sub-division according to dry density; low density {\textless}600kgm−3, medium density 600–1000kgm−3, and high density {\textgreater}1000kgm−3. Analysis of biological data showed significant differences for the upper mudflats, where sediment type and grain size are the best physical descriptors of the biological attributes, but none for the middle and lower flats. The results agree well with a previously published typology, which can be used to extend this statistical classification to account for such features as bedforms.

Here we present an analysis of over 700,000 satellite images that maps the global extent of and change in tidal flats over the course of 33 years (1984–2016). We find that tidal flats, defined as sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation7, occupy at least 127,921 km2 (124,286–131,821 km2, 95\% confidence interval). About 70\% of the global extent of tidal flats is found in three continents (Asia (44\% of total), North America (15.5\% of total) and South America (11\% of total)), with 49.2\% being concentrated in just eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil and Myanmar). For regions with sufficient data to develop a consistent multi-decadal time series—which included East Asia, the Middle East and North America—we estimate that 16.02\% (15.62–16.47\%, 95\% confidence interval) of tidal flats were lost between 1984 and 2016. Extensive degradation from coastal development1, reduced sediment delivery from major rivers8,9, sinking of riverine deltas8,10, increased coastal erosion and sea-level rise11 signal a continuing negative trajectory for tidal flat ecosystems around the world. Our high-spatial-resolution dataset delivers global maps of tidal flats, which substantially advances our understanding of the distribution, trajectory and status of these poorly known coastal ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In approximately one decade, global temperatures will likely exceed a warming level that a United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report considers a “red alert for humanity”. We propose exploring tidal flat diatoms to address climate change challenges. Tidal flats are extensive coastal ecosystems crucial to the provisioning and regulation of aquatic environments. Diatoms contribute to tidal flat biomass production and account for 20\% of global primary productivity and 40\% of annual marine biomass production, making them crucial for nutrient cycling and sediment stabilization. Potential CO2 removal from Korean tidal flats by diatoms is estimated to be 598,457–683,171 t CO2 equivalents (CO2e) annually, with the economic value of blue carbon (BC) resulting from diatom activity being approximately US\$ 17.95–20.50 million. Dissemination of this potential could incentivize coastal wetland protection and climate change mitigation measures. The global estimated CO2e removal potential of tidal flat diatoms is 40,957,346–46,754,961 t CO2e, representing 0.11–0.13\% of the annual global greenhouse gas emissions, even though tidal flats cover 0.0025\% of the Earth’s surface and diatoms represent less than 0.5\% (by weight) of all photosynthetic plants. Researchers should combine ecology and economics to develop standardized approaches for carbon input monitoring and quantification. Further, spatiotemporal analyses of environmental threats to tidal flat diatoms are necessary for conserving their biodiversity and function as a critical BC source. Land-based cultivation for large-scale biomass production and biorefinery processes can contribute to a greener, more prosperous future for humanity and the marine ecosystems upon which we rely.},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) is composed of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that colonize intertidal sediments within the first millimeters of the photic zone and form biofilms at low tide. In estuaries, this benthic group can represent the main primary producer and deliver several ecosystem services. However, it is not currently used as a bioindicator of water quality, contrary to the widespread use of phytobenthos in freshwater settings. This study assesses the potential of developing MBP metrics to assess water quality in transitional waters using Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. A Random Forest machine learning classification was used to distinguish different types of intertidal vegetation in 26 French estuaries and bays, in particular MPB and green macroalgae (chlorophytes), using multispectral indices. High accuracy was generally achieved for the identification of MPB when compared with field validation data, for both User’s and Producer’s accuracies, which corresponded to 94\% and 84\% respectively. Two Earth observation variables were retrieved: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy of MPB biomass, and MPB percent cover integrated over the entire intertidal area of the water body. From a total of 918 S2 images from over a full year, 28\% were exploitable due to the combined requirements of cloud-free pixels collected during low tide. With its 10 m spatial resolution, S2 was able to map all estuaries. MPB percent cover showed a stronger gradient between estuaries than MPB NDVI. MPB percent cover was also significantly correlated with green macroalgae percent cover, and a group of estuaries characterized by the highest MPB and green macroalgae coverage corresponded to eutrophic sites impacted by intensive farming activities. A multivariate analysis confirmed that MPB percent cover was indeed related to nutrients. It was also related to sediment type which was one of the main factors underlying differences between estuaries. This work is a first step toward a water quality metric using MPB, and several recommendations are proposed to refine this approach. Sentinel-2 imagery, which is publicly available, presents an interesting compromise to map estuarine microphytobenthos in order to assess the ecological status of transitional waters.},

	abstract = {Benthic diatom communities have been documented many times to exhibit a predictable pattern of migration entrained to diurnal and tidal cycles forming transient biofilms in the estuarine intertidal. The highly visible nature of these biofilms means that many anecdotal descriptions of this behaviour exist, yet much still remains to be elucidated about these behaviours and what drives them. There has been a resurgence in work examining the migratory patterns of benthic diatoms because of the important roles they play in the overall functioning of the ecosystem (e.g. primary production). It is the aim of this paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the migratory literature to date. The paper will review the methodology that was historically used to examine patterns in diatom migration as well as introduce new technologies (e.g. remote sensing). The patterns and cues for migration are discussed, highlighting the fact that whilst a “classic” pattern of migration is often found (migration of cells to the sediment surface as the tide leaves the site followed by a downwards migration in anticipation of the incoming tide), these cannot be considered to be consistent, with many site and taxon specific idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, it has been suggested that cells also migrate within the biofilm, cycling their position at the sediment surface therefore maximising their overall fitness, and this hypothesis is discussed. The vertical migration strategy of the benthic diatoms is critical to their pivotal role in the structure and functioning of estuarine intertidal mudflats and the costs and benefits of a microphytobenthic existence are discussed in this context.},

In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the IR and red linear combinations vis-à-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and IR linear combinations had 7\% and 14\% greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6\% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic IR radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation uses a wide range of vegetation indices (VIs) to monitor plant characteristics, but these indices can be very sensitive to canopy background reflectance. This study investigated background influences on VIs applied to intertidal microphytobenthos, using a synthetic spectral library constituted by a spectral combination of three contrasting types of sediment (sand, fine sand, and mud) and reflectance spectra of benthic diatom monospecific cultures obtained in controlled conditions. The spectral database exhibited, for the same biomass range (3–182mgchlorophyllam−2), marked differences in albedo and spectral contrast linked to sediment variability in water content, grain size, and organic matter content. Several VIs were evaluated, from ratios using visible and near infrared wavelengths, to hyperspectral indices (derivative analysis, continuum removal). Among the ratios, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) appeared less sensitive to background effects than VIs with soil corrections such as the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Modified second Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) or the Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI). The lower efficacy of soil-corrected VIs may be explained by the structural differences and optical behavior of soil vs. canopies compared to sediment vs. microphytobenthos biofilms. The background effects were minimized using Modified Gaussian Model indices at 632nm and 675nm, and the second derivative at 632nm, while poor results were obtained with the red-edge inflection point (REIP) and the second derivative at 675nm. The least sensitive index was the Phytobenthos Index which is very similar to the NDVI, but uses a red wavelength at 632nm instead of 675nm, to account for the absorption by chlorophyll c. The modified NDVI705, where the 705nm wavelength replaces the red band, showed moderate background sensitivity. Moreover, the NDVI705 and the Phytobenthos Index have the additional relevant property of being less sensitive to the index saturation response with increasing biomass. Unfortunately, these VIs cannot be applied to broad-band multispectral satellite images, and require sensors with a hyperspectral resolution. Nevertheless, this study showed that the background influence was not a limitation to applying the ubiquitous NDVI to map intertidal microphytobenthos using multispectral satellite images.},

	abstract = {We studied pore water seepage and associated nutrient release in the Janssand intertidal sand flat (North Sea) during exposure at low tide. The hydraulic gradient developing at ebb tide between the pore water level in the elevated sand flat and the water level in the tidal gully generated interstitial water flows toward the seepage zone with velocities ranging from 0.5 (March) to 0.9 cm h–1 (July). Pore water was discharged from an approximately 20 m wide zone near the seaward margin of the flat at rates of 2.4 (March) and 4.2 l m–2 d–1 (July). Nutrient and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations of the seepage water exceeded those measured in the pore water of the upper section of the flat by 10- and 5-fold, respectively. Nutrient effluxes through seepage reached 1100 and 7600 µmol m–2 d–1 for NH4, 280 and 2500 µmol m–2 d–1 for PO4 and 140 and 1700 µmol m–2 d–1 for Si(OH)4 in March and July, respectively. Benthic flux chambers revealed that nutrients and DIC were released from the still submerged sediment as soon as the ebb tide exposed the upper section of the elevated flat. A conservative estimate based on our measurements suggests that 168000 l (March) to 294000 l (July) pore water are discharged each day from the sandy northeastern margin of the Janssand (3.5 km length, 70000 m2). Nutrients contained in this water corresponded to 6–25 kg d–1 (90 to 350 mg m–2 d–1) carbon mineralized during March and 42–223 kg d–1 (600 to 3200 mg C m–2 d–1) during July. Our study indicates that the Janssand intertidal flat does not accumulate organic matter but releases mineralization products that can account for all the organic matter that is potentially filtered through the permeable beds during a tidal cycle. Nutrient fluxes associated with seepage exceeded 5- to 8-fold those fluxes caused by the combined effects of diffusion, advection and bioirrigation during inundation, emphasizing the importance of sand flat drainage to the nutrient cycles in the Wadden Sea.},

	abstract = {This study presents an innovative approach to map microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover in Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast) using Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS) hyperspectral data. Microphytobenthos is a microalgae forming a biofilm on the mudflat. Its spatial distribution is heterogeneous so it varies on a finer scale than that of airborne instrument spatial resolution, leading to a “mixed pixel” problem. Moreover, some microphytobenthic species form, at low tide, a biofilm deposited at the surface of the sediment substrate. The resulting signal is a highly non-linear combination of spectral endmembers due to microscale intimate mixtures. This prevents the use of classical linear unmixing models to retrieve biomass from reflectance spectra. A Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) is therefore used to remove the effects of surface roughness, shadowing and any other unknown processes that contribute to the overall shape (continuum) of the reflectance spectra. Then, relationships between microphytobenthos biomass and spectral shapes are derived from a spectral database compiled from laboratory reflectance spectra of microalgal monospecific cultures with different biomasses. Finally, microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover are retrieved from the DAIS image by comparing the reflectance spectra of each pixel to a library of synthetic spectra corresponding to combinations of various biomasses and substrate percent cover. This new approach, when compared to more classically used ones such as indices, linear unmixing or spectral distance analysis, is proven to enable a much more reliable determination of biomass despite the large variety of substrates found in Bourgneuf Bay.},

As such areas, particularly mudflats of limited access for point sampling, remote sensing techniques have the potential to map diatom biomass. This study used two monospecific cultures of the benthic diatoms Navicula ramosissima and Entomoneis paludosa, isolated from mudflats in Bourgneuf Bay (France), to obtain a biomass range. Exponential and senescent stages of microalgal growth were also tested. The objective was to relate the spectral reflectance obtained by spectroradiometry to the composition and amount of principal and accessory pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Analysis of pigments vs. chlorophyll a ratios revealed differences between these two diatom species, mainly due to fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin. These interspecific variations among the class of Bacillariophyceae were also detected by spectroradiometry. No differences were observed between the two growth stages, and cell senescence had no effects on spectral properties. The chlorophyll pigments used to establish a relationship between diatom biomass and spectral reflectance gave the most interesting results for an absorption band at 632 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c. This band, contrary to that at 673 nm related to chlorophyll a only and traditionally used for biomass estimations in green plants, provided the largest range of variations and was not saturated at a high biomass concentration.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal changes in microphytobenthos species composition were investigated in relation to structural variables—biomass; life-forms; detritus ratio, pheopigment a (pheo a):chl a; and sediment characteristics—at mesoscale in a shellfish macrotidal ecosystem. To characterize algae assemblages, multivariate analyses were performed (multidimensional scaling [MDS] ordination and clustering), supported by correlations between structural variables. Microphytobenthos, dominated by 97\% diatoms belonging to 89 taxa, was constituted by two main assemblages: The first one, composed of common species (occurrence {\textgreater}50\%), mainly nanobenthic (size {\textless}30 μm) and epipsammic (sand-fixed cells), was associated with mixed sediments. The major species contributing to this assemblage were Navicula perminuta, Achnanthes hauckiana, Fallacia tenera, A. lanceolata var. elleptica, Amphora spp., Plagiogrammopsis vanheurkii, and Plagiogramma tenuissimum (see Table 2 for taxonomic authors). Species diversity was high (N1∼ 11), often linked to high biomass values ({\textgreater}70 mg chl a · m−2) and low detritus ratio. Conversely, the second assemblage comprised occasional species (occurrence from 10\% to 50\%), mainly microbenthic ({\textgreater}30 μm) and epipelic (moving cells), occurring during summer at muddy sites. This assemblage, characterized by low diversity, high biomass variability, and high detritus ratio, was dominated by Scolioneis tumida or Plagiotropis vitrea and Navicula spartinetensis. Whereas hydrodynamics globally explained the gradual assemblage changes throughout the entire mudflat and the year, oyster beds and ridge and runnel features appeared to be local spatial structuring factors allowing the establishment of specific assemblages. This study suggests a significant role for epipsammon biomass, until now underestimated, in the functioning of this turbid coastal ecosystem. 2 Microphytobenthic taxa identified from samples from the first 2 mm of sediment from Bourgneuf Bay (France) mudflat between May 2000 and July 2001.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of turbid coastal ecosystems, focusing on spatio-temporal changes at the mesoscale in microphytobenthos structures in a macrotidal bay (Bourgneuf, France). This was based on pigment analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), reinforced by microscopy observations, in relation to sediment characteristics. Microphytobenthos assemblages of this mudflat were 97\% dominated by diatoms, confirmed by HPLC analysis, which showed biomarker pigments of this group: chlorophyll c, fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin. The main assemblage is constituted of epipsammic species, like Plagiogrammopsis, Achnanthes and Cocconeis, characterising mixed sediments. However, this could be replaced by epipelic species, like Plagiotropis, Pleurosigma and Staurophora, during summer due to station silting. Microphytobenthic photosynthetic active biomass in the first 2 mm varied spatially and temporally from 12.2 to 186.9 mg chl a m–2. The predominance of a biomass spatial variability reflected spatial changes in sediment grain size and water content. Biomass in the first 2 mm represented from 28 to 68\% of the total amount in the first 10 mm. This indicated an accumulation of biomass in illuminated layers and a biomass decrease with depth associated with increasing values of the ratio of phaeopigments a and fucoxanthin to chlorophyll a (phaeo a/chl a and fuco/chl a). Both could exceed 1.00 in deeper layers. Temporal changes in microphytobenthos structure at the mesoscale were mainly linked to hydrodynamism. This is stronger in winter and responsible for allochthonous pigment input (lutein and phaeophytin b) and sediment mixing, as grazing activity by macro- and meiofauna, forming chlorophyll a breakdown products, is responsible for an increase in fuco/chl a and phaeo a/chl a values during spring/summer.},

	abstract = {The effect of high (ambient) and low (shaded to 50\% of ambient) light on microphytobenthic biofilm primary production, vertical migration and allocation of photoassimilated carbon into extracellular carbohydrates was investigated over the low
tide emersion period at Sarilhos Pequenos on the Tagus estuary, Portugal, in July 2000. Carbon uptake (14C measurements), electron transport (pulse-amplitude modulated [PAM]-fluorescence) and carbon allocation into extracellular carbohydrate
fractions were measured. There was a decrease in the maximum rate of primary production (Pmax) (14C) over the emersion period (16 decreasing to 5 mg C m-2 h-1 at midday and the end of emersion,
respectively) that was independent of the incident light and the light history to which the biofilms had been exposed. Primary production (14C) did not correlate with measurements of in situ relative electron transport rate (rel.ETR),
due in part to the light-induced migration of the cells away from the sediment surface during periods of high irradiance (photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD] {\textgreater} 1200 mol m-2 s-1). Downward migration coincided with the light
level at which Pmax (14C) was reached, 750 mol m-2 s-1, and with a point of inflexion on the rel.ETR versus PPFD curve. Above this light level rel.ETR was over-estimated due to migration of the cells into
a lower light field in the sediment. Shading significantly increased the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production rate (from 0.4 to 1.0 mg C m-2 h-1 in ambient and shaded light, respectively) and percentage allocation of
photoassimilates into EPS (from 4 ± 1.0 to 18 ± 3.5\% of total production in ambient and shaded light, respectively). In contrast, percentage allocation of photoassimilates to low molecular weight extracellular carbohydrate was higher in the non-shaded
treatments (35 ± 4.5\% compared with 13 ± 3.8\% in ambient and shaded treatments, respectively), probably due to photosynthetic Œoverflow¹. In non-shaded biofilms there was little or no increase in the concentration of all extracellular carbohydrate
fractions until the last hour before tidal immersion. Results indicate that diel patterns in microphytobenthic primary production are not predictable solely from light data.},

	abstract = {Tagus intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB) assemblages were characterized over a wide range of sediment type and tidal height and the possible effects of these variables on MPB spatial distribution and photo-adaptation mechanisms were investigated. Two transects with six different sediment type and different tidal height sites were sampled once every two months from 2002 to 2004. Upper shore and sandy sites showed higher chlorophyll a (chl a) content, with sandy sediments showing a biomass peak in late winter–early spring, and muddy sites showing no obvious seasonal pattern. Stepwise multiple linear regressions showed that only SiO2, tidal height and sediment particle size {\textless}63μm were significant variables (p{\textless}0.05), explaining 50\% of MPB biomass spatial–temporal variability. However, when data were separated by transect, only tidal height remained significant at both transects. Sandier sediments exhibited higher zeaxanthin/chl a and lower fucoxanthin/chl a ratios characteristic of a mixed cyanobacteria/diatom assemblages, showing an alternate seasonality with cyanobacteria increasing in summer and diatoms dominating in spring. Diatom biofilms showed contrasting features depending on the sediment type. Epipsammic diatoms were small with an average length of around 10μm, while epipelic diatoms showed a wider size range with size distribution peaks at 10–15μm, 25–35μm and {\textgreater}60μm. Epipelic biofilms showed evidence of being low light-acclimated (high fucoxanthin/chl a) and of photo-regulating by vertical migration movements (presence of endogenous vertical rhythms and lower diatoxanthin/diadinoxanthin). Epipsammic biofilms showed higher diatoxanthin/diadinoxanthin ratios and no vertical migration rhythms. Thus, the two diatom biofilm types had distinct strategies to photo-regulate: epipelic diatoms using vertical migration to position themselves at the sediment depth of optimum light conditions, and epipsammic diatoms using the xanthophyll cycle to photo-regulate. Further studies comparing epipsammic and epipelic assemblages are necessary to better understand MPB photo-regulation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The distribution of microphytobenthos on intertidal flats is heterogeneous and described as “patchy” over spatial scales of centimetres to kilometres. The spatial structure and the dynamics of microphytobenthic biomass during tidal emersion were investigated by creating high resolution fluorescence distribution maps of biomass (Fo) at the sediment surface (0.5cm pixels, 20cm×20cm). The PSII maximum quantum efficiency was also calculated for correlation with biomass structure. Intertidal areas of the Biezelingsche Ham (Westerschelde) and Zandkreek (Oosterschelde), The Netherlands, were sampled during June 2000. The space–time variability of the discrete fields obtained was analysed by studying their spatial variogram and their time autocorrelation. Sites showed significant differences in absolute variation of microphytobenthic biomass and in the dynamics of the development of spatial structure throughout the emersion period. The variograms indicated little spatial correlations in the biomass fields above the 2cm scale, while the time autocorrelation showed a strong persistence of biomass structure at time scales between 1h and 5h. The Biezelingse Ham biofilm was shown to be migratory in nature while the Zandkreek system was more stable. At the former site, biomass distribution became more homogenous with time, as upward migration of cells attenuated horizontal patchiness. At the Biezelingsche Ham site, maximum PSII quantum efficiencies varied inversely with biomass areas; reasons for this may include nutrient depletion and CO2 limitation within dense biofilms.},

	abstract = {Intertidal soft sediment microphytobenthic biofilms are often dominated by diatoms, which are able to regulate their photosynthesis by physiological processes (e.g. down-regulation through the xanthophyll cycle, referred to as non-photochemical quenching, NPQ) and behavioural processes (e.g. vertical cell movement in the sediment–biofilm matrix). This study investigated these 2 processes over a 6 h emersion period using chemical inhibitors under 2 light treatments (ambient and constant light at 300 µmol m–2 s–1). Latrunculin A (Lat A) was used to inhibit cell movement and dithiothreitol (DTT) to inhibit NPQ. HPLC analysis for chlorophyll a and spectral analysis (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) indicated that Lat A significantly inhibited cell movement. Photosynthetic activity was measured using variable chlorophyll fluorescence and radiolabelled carbon uptake and showed that the non-migratory, Lat A-treated biofilms were severely inhibited as a result of the high accumulated light dose (significantly reduced maximum relative electron transport rate, rETRmax, and light utilisation coefficient, α, compared to the migratory DTT and control-treated biofilms). No significant patterns were observed for 14C data, although a decrease in uptake rate was observed over the measurement period. NPQ was investigated using HPLC analysis of xanthophyll pigments (diatoxanthin and the percentage de-epoxidation of diadinoxanthin), chlorophyll fluorescence (change in maximum fluorescence yield) and the 2nd order spectral derivative index (diatoxanthin index). Patterns between methods varied, but overall data indicated greater NPQ induction in the non-migratory Lat A treatment and little or no NPQ induction in the DTT and control treatments. Overall, the data resulted in 2 main conclusions: (1) the primary response to accumulated light dose was vertical movement, which when inhibited resulted in severe down-regulation/photoinhibition; (2) diatoms down-regulated their photosynthetic activity in response to accumulated light dose (e.g. over an emersion period) using a combination of vertical migration and physiological mechanisms that may contribute to diel and/or tidal patterns in productivity.},

Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A machine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi- and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy ({\textgreater}80\%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95\%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (∼530 and ∼ 730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classification at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {The Gross Primary Production (GPP) of intertidal mudflat microphytobenthos supports important ecosystem services such as shoreline stabilization, food production and it contributes to the Blue Carbon. However, monitoring microphytobenthos GPP over long term and large spatial scale is rendered difficult by its high temporal and spatial variability. To overcome this issue, we developed an algorithm to map microphytobenthos GPP in which are coupled: (i) NDVI maps derived from high spatial resolution satellite images (SPOT6 or Pléiades) estimating the horizontal distribution of the microphytobenthos biomass; (ii) emersion time, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and mud surface temperature simulated from the physical model MARS-3D; (iii) photophysiological parameters retrieved from Production-Irradiance (P-E) curves obtained under controlled conditions of PAR and temperature using benthic chambers and expressing the production rate into mg C h-1 m-2 ndvi-1. The productivity was directly calibrated to NDVI to be consistent with remote-sensing measurements of microphytobenthos biomass, and spatially upscaled using satellite-derived NDVI maps acquired at different seasons. The remotely-sensed microphytobenthos GPP reasonably compared with in situ GPP measurements. It was highest in March with a daily production reaching 50.2 mg C m-2 d-1, and lowest in July with a daily production of 22.3 mg C m-2 d-1. Our remote sensing algorithm is a new step in the perspective of mapping microphytobenthos GPP over large mudflats to estimate its actual contribution to ecosystem functions, including blue carbon, from local and global scales.},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) at the sediment surface of intertidal mudflats are known to show a high spatial and temporal variability in response to the biotic and abiotic conditions prevailing at the mud surface. It makes long term and large scale monitoring of MPB Gross Primary Production (GPP) difficult to set up. In this study, we developed the first 3D physical-biological coupled model (MARS-3D) that explicitly simulates GPP of intertidal MPB at the mudflat scale and we compared the outputs with in situ and space remote sensing MPB GPP data. We discuss the sources of discrepancies between the modelling and the remote sensing approach in the light of future developments to be done. For instance, the remote sensing algorithm provides a very synoptic view of the mudflat GPP. It is well suited to achieve diagnostic estimates of MPB GPP at the synoptic spatial and temporal scale. By contrast, the MARS-3D model provides a more dynamic representation of the MPB activity and prognostic estimates of MPB GPP over the mudflat. It is very relevant to resolve the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of MPB. Getting comparable GPP estimates derived from the remote sensing algorithm and 3D physical-biological coupled model will further require a better convergence in terms of equations structure, biological constants parametrisation, and source data used (i.e. vegetation index vs chlorophyll a). Setting a common parametrisation in both the numerical model and remote sensing algorithm might be challenging in a perspective of mapping MPB PP over large mudflats from a synoptic to inter-annual time scale, but it could open the door to a new way of quantifying MPB GPP over large intertidal mudflats.},

	abstract = {The microphytobenthos are fascinating communities of microalgae and cyanobacteria that inhabit benthic habitats in marine and freshwater ecosystems. These often apparently barren landscapes are in fact a ‘secret garden’, harboring an immense microbial diversity and intense photosynthetic and biogeochemical activity (MacIntyre et al., 1996; Underwood and Kromkamp, 1999). On the intertidal flats of estuaries and beneath shallow coastal waters, the microphytobenthos are dominated by pennate diatoms, the most recently evolved and most diversified of this important group of protists (Kooistra et al., 2007; Benoiston et al., 2017). Microphytobenthos have mostly been studied in temperate estuaries, but they have a widespread distribution from polar regions (Woelfel et al., 2014) to the tropics (Underwood, 2002). Over the last decades, microphytobenthos have attracted considerable interest mainly due to their role as a main contributor to the productivity of estuarine and shallow coastal areas (Hope et al., 2019). With a global annual gross primary production estimated to be in the order of 500 Mt of carbon, these ecosystems can be responsible for up to 20\% of the ocean gross primary production although occupying only 0.03\% of the ocean surface area (Pinckney, 2018). For estuarine ecosystems, microphytobenthos primary production can be comparable to that of the phytoplankton and can provide up to more than 50\% of total ecosystem-level carbon fixation (Underwood and Kromkamp, 1999)...},

They were analysed in terms of biomass, diversity, species composition and growth form distribution. The assemblages of the 2 upstream sites were characterised by high biomass and lower diversities and were mostly dominated by epipelon. The 2 downstream, most haline sites had lower biomass and higher diversities and were dominated by both epipelon and tychoplankton. Diversity did not exhibit a clear seasonal signal in the upstream mudflats, but it was higher during the first half of the study in the downstream sites. The coexistence of 2 growth forms seems to increase diversity of the mudflat assemblages. Species distribution was mainly linked to changes in sediment texture and salinity, both with a marked seasonal variability. MPB biomass was inversely related to MPB diversity and positively related to both mud content and the epipelon. MPB diversity was not, however, significantly correlated with mud content. Slight changes in sediment texture, even if causing variations in assemblage composition, did not change overall diversity. The existence of an important and even dominant tychoplanktonic fraction could be considered a distinctive feature of these benthic environments in the Loire, as well as in other macrotidal estuaries.},

However, image classification is challenging due to spectral similarity between microphytobenthos and oyster reefs. Because these elements are strongly related to local geomorphic features, including biogenic structures, a new mapping method has been developed to overcome the current obstacles. This method is based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), RGB, and multispectral (four bands: green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared) surveys that combine high spatial resolution (e.g., 5 cm pixel), geomorphic mapping, and machine learning random forest (RF) classification. A mudflat on the Atlantic coast of France (Marennes-Oléron bay) was surveyed based on this method and by using the structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetric approach to produce orthophotographs and digital surface models (DSM). Eight classes of mudflat surface based on indexes, such as NDVI and spectral bands normalised to NIR, were identified either on the whole image (i.e., standard RF classification) or after segmentation into five geomorphic units mapped from DSM (i.e., geomorphic-based RF classification). The classification accuracy was higher with the geomorphic-based RF classification (93.12\%) than with the standard RF classification (73.45\%), showing the added value of combining topographic and radiometric data to map soft-bottom intertidal areas and the user-friendly potential of this method in applications to other ecosystems, such as wetlands or peatlands.},

	abstract = {In temperate coastal regions of Western Europe, the polychaete Sabellaria alveolata (Linné) builds large intertidal reefs of several hectares on soft-bottom substrates. These reefs are protected by the European Habitat Directive EEC/92/43 under the status of biogenic structures hosting a high biodiversity and providing ecological functions such as protection against coastal erosion. As an alternative to time-consuming field campaigns, a UAV-based Structure-from-Motion photogrammetric survey was carried out in October 2020 over Noirmoutier Island (France) where the second-largest known European reef is located in a tidal delta. A DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral UAV provided a topographic dataset at very high resolutions of 5 cm/pixel for the Digital Surface Model (DSM) and 2.63 cm/pixel for the multispectral orthomosaic images. The reef footprint was mapped using a combination of two topographic indices: the Topographic Openness Index and the Topographic Position Index. The reef structures covered an area of 8.15 ha, with 89\% corresponding to the main reef composed of connected and continuous biogenic structures, 7.6\% of large isolated structures ({\textless}60 m2), and 4.4\% of small isolated reef clumps ({\textless}2 m2). To further describe the topographic complexity of the reef, the Geomorphon landform classification was used. The spatial distribution of tabular platforms considered as a healthy stage of the reef in contrast to a degraded stage was mapped with a proxy that consists in comparing the reef volume to a theoretical tabular-shaped reef volume. Epibionts colonizing the reef (macroalgae, mussels, and oysters) were also mapped by combining multispectral indices such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and simple band ratios with topographic indices. A confusion matrix showed that macroalgae and mussels were satisfactorily identified but that oysters could not be detected by an automated procedure due to their spectral complexity. The topographic indices used in this work should now be further exploited to propose a health index for these large intertidal reefs.},

The dual-pol (VV-VH) Sentinel-1 SAR data are being utilized for the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as well as for other national projects, which are providing Sentinel derived information to support crop monitoring networks. Among the Earth observation products identified for agriculture monitoring, indicators of vegetation status are deemed critical by end-user communities. In literature, several experiments usually utilize the backscatter intensities to characterize crops. In this study, we have jointly utilized the scattering information in terms of the degree of polarization and the eigenvalue spectrum to derive a new vegetation index from dual-pol (DpRVI) SAR data. We assess the utility of this index as an indicator of plant growth dynamics for canola, soybean, and wheat, over a test site in Canada. A temporal analysis of DpRVI with crop biophysical variables (viz., Plant Area Index (PAI), Vegetation Water Content (VWC), and dry biomass (DB)) at different phenological stages confirms its trend with plant growth dynamics. For each crop type, the DpRVI is compared with the cross and co-pol ratio (σVH0/σVV0) and dual-pol Radar Vegetation Index (RVI = 4σVH0/(σVV0 + σVH0)), Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (PRVI), and the Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index (DPSVI). Statistical analysis with biophysical variables shows that the DpRVI outperformed the other four vegetation indices, yielding significant correlations for all three crops. Correlations between DpRVI and biophysical variables are highest for canola, with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.79 (PAI), 0.82 (VWC), and 0.75 (DB). DpRVI had a moderate correlation (R2≳ 0.6) with the biophysical parameters of wheat and soybean. Good retrieval accuracies of crop biophysical parameters are also observed for all three crops.},

The studies utilize microwave backscatter collected from 1) dielectric surfaces in an anechoic chamber and 2) a desert test site using P-, L-, and C-band NASA/JPL AIRSAR data. These experimental studies and supporting theory, indicate a sensitive decrease of {\textbar}/spl rho//sub RRLL/{\textbar} with increasing surface roughness ks over a range 0 /spl les/ ks /spl les/ 1. For the present studies this decrease is caused largely by the depolarizing effects of small-scale surface slopes in the azimuth direction rather than by volume, or multiple scatter. For cases when the scatter is reflection symmetric, the value of {\textbar}/spl rho//sub RRLL/{\textbar} depends on the surface roughness and on the local incidence angle. The dependence of {\textbar}/spl rho//sub PRRLL/{\textbar} on the local incidence angle is supported by theory and experimental results. For these same scattering cases, however, {\textbar}/spl rho//sub PRRLL/{\textbar} is independent of the surface dielectric constant. Estimation of the functional dependency of {\textbar}/spl rho//sub PRRLL/{\textbar} versus ks, for a mid-range incidence angle, has been carried out using roughness estimates derived from an empirical model.},

This paper proposes a new classification scheme for mud and sand flats on intertidal flats using fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Freeman-Durden (FD) and Cloude-Pottier (CP) polarimetric decomposition components as well as double bounce eigenvalue relative difference (DERD) are introduced into the feature sets instead of the original intensity polarimetric channels. Classification is carried out using the random forest (RF) theory, and the results are evaluated using confusion matrices, kappa coefficients, and RF variable importance indices. Three study sites with different environmental conditions are chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification chain. To further assess the performance of the proposed feature set, we set different feature combinations and process with the same processing chain. Results show that the DERD parameter can detail the sediment mappings on exposed intertidal flats and is a useful SAR feature to distinguish mud and sand flats efficiently. The combined FD and CP components have the ability to describe the polarimetric characteristics of sediments more correctly than the commonly used original intensity channels. Meanwhile, the RF theory shows great potential in distinguishing sediments in intertidal zones accurately and time efficiently.},

to characterize the Œphotosynthetically active biomass¹ of the epipelic community, a new approach to describe the photic environment at the sediment surface, by substituting a discrete 2-layer model in place of continuous vertical light distribution.
This concept thus allows us to build a functional representation of the distribution of the photosynthetically active biomass in the sediment and, by then integrating the light and temperature forcing of the latter biomass, to predict the dynamics of the
whole epipelic community on short-term time scales. The model then clearly reveals an oscillatory behavior of the total biomass at the surface of the sediment, consistent with field biomass daily measurements performed during a spring-neap tidal cycle.
Biomass increases occur during the diurnal emersion phase, in alternation with decreases during the submersion and nocturnal emersion phases; the dynamics of intertidal microphytobenthos is thus controlled by the night/day cycle and tidal hydrodynamic
forcing, which determines the fast changes in environmental conditions (light and nutrient availability, temperature) which epipelic microalgae experience. The similarity between model simulations and field observations leads us to conclude that the
conceptual framework of the model is valid.},

Water and sediment temperature data collected in the Venice lagoon show that, in shallow, temperate lagoons, temperature is uniform within the water column, and enabled us to estimate the net heat flux at the sediment-water interface. We modeled this flux as the sum of a conductive component and of the solar radiation reaching the bottom, finding the latter being negligible. We developed a “point” model to describe the temperature dynamics of the sediment-water continuum driven by vertical energy transfer. We applied the model considering conditions characterized by negligible advection, obtaining satisfactory results. We found that the heat exchange between water and sediment is crucial for describing sediment temperature but plays a minor role on the water temperature.},

Dans cette thèse, nous utilisons un modèle couplé physique-biologie pour étudier la variabilité spatio-temporelle de la dynamique du MPB sur une vasière intertidale de la côte Atlantique française. Le modèle simule explicitement la biomasse du MPB et du brouteur Peringia ulvae. Les résultats fournissent des conclusions clés sur la dynamique du MPB. À l’hiver et au printemps, une lumière et une température de surface de la vase (TSV) optimales pour la croissance du MPB donnent lieu à une efflorescence printanière du MPB. La lumière est le facteur le plus limitant annuellement. Cependant, la TSV limite la croissance du MPB 40 \% du temps en été. La photoinhibition pourrait se superposer à la thermoinhibition au printemps et en été. Le broutage et la remise en suspension (RES) du MPB façonnent également la dynamique du MPB. La bioturbation par P. ulvae contribue à une RES chronique du MPB du sédiment vers la colonne d’eau au printemps et en été. Les vagues contribuent à la RES du MPB par le biais d’événements de RES massive en hiver, au printemps et en automne. 50 \% de la PP annuelle du MPB est exporté vers la colonne d’eau par le biais de RES chroniques et massives. Nous avons également développé une méthode qui combine les données de télédétection et les résultats du modèle couplé physique-biologique en un algorithme capable de prédire la PP à partir de données satellitales. En plus d’apporter de nouvelles perspectives sur la dynamique du MPB, ce travail propose de nouveaux outils numériques pour surveiller et prédire la PP du MPB et son devenir dans les eaux côtières dans un contexte de changement climatique.},

La spatialisation est conditionnee par un modele hydrodynamique qui calcule la hauteur d'eau en tout point. L'environnement photique du microphytobenthos est decrit de facon discrete par une couche s de diatomees en surface du sediment et une couche f representant le centimetre superficiel de la vase. La migration verticale active des cellules definit les echanges entre ces deux couches, orientes du fond vers la surface en periode d'exondation diurne et de la surface vers le fond en periodes d'exondation nocturne et de submersion. A cause de cette difference de comportement migratoire, deux sous-systemes d'equations differentielles ont ete formules. Pendant la periode d'exondation diurne, seules les algues en surface peuvent photosynthetiser, en beneficiant de la totalite de la lumiere incidente ; le nombre de places en surface est limite si bien que les echanges du fond vers la surface sont densite-dependants. Les processus de production ont ete etudies experimentalement ; en particulier, le controle a court-terme de la capacite photosynthetique par la temperature a ete mis en equation. Par la suite, un modele decrivant la dynamique de la temperature de surface de la vase a permis de caracteriser le forcage des potentialites de production a l'echelle de l'ecosysteme et a mis en evidence un phenomene de thermo-inhibition qui se generalise en ete.

Coastal groundwater discharge, including submarine groundwater discharge, may provide stabilizing conditions for intertidal zone permeable sediments. In this study, we integrated detailed time series temperature observations, porewater pressure measurements, and two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography profiles to understand the coupled hydraulic-thermal regime of a tropical sandy intertidal zone in a fringing coral reef lagoon (Rarotonga, Cook Islands). We found three heating patterns across the 15 m study transect over tidal and diel periods: (1) a highly variable thermal regime dominated by swash infiltration and changes in saturation state in the upper foreshore with net heat import into the sediment, (2) a groundwater-supported underground stable, cool region just seaward of the intertidal slope break also importing heat into the subsurface, and (3) a zone of seawater recirculation that sustained consistently warm subsurface temperatures that exported heat across the sediment-water interface. Simple calculations suggested thermal conduction as the main heat transport mechanism for the shallow intertidal sediment, but deeper and/or multidimensional groundwater flow was required to explain temperature patterns beyond 20 cm depth. Temperature differences between the distinct hydrodynamic zones of the foreshore site resulted in significant thermal gradients that persisted beyond tidal and diel periods. The thermal buffering of intertidal zones by coastal groundwater systems, both at surface seeps and in the shallow subsurface, can be responsible for thermal refugia for some coastal organisms and hotspots for biogeochemical reactions.},

	abstract = {The physiology of the diel movements of epipelic microphytobenthic diatoms is not fully understood. As well, the evolutionary pressures that led to migratory behavior and the ecological role of vertical migrations remain unknown. The behavioral photoprotection hypothesis, according to which the diatoms move along the vertical light gradient to find their optimal light environment, is the most generally accepted. However, the motion is associated with an energy cost that has not been fully acknowledged before. To throw light on this issue, we looked at the mechanisms of diatom locomotion and reviewed their patterns of movement. Making use of published data, we estimated an energy cost of 0.12 pJ for a typical diatom cell to move upward (or downward) in a 400 µm photic zone. This amounts to 3.93x10-18 mol of ATP, which are released by the oxidation of 1.31 x10-19 mol of glucose. This represents only 0.0001\% of the daily net photosynthetic production of a typical microphytobenthic diatom cell, showing that diel vertical migrations have a negligible impact on cell and ecosystem energy budget. Even though the migration energy cost of individual cells may depart almost two orders of magnitude from the central value presented for a typical diatom (depending on cell size, velocity of displacement and viscosity of the medium), the maximum value calculated is still negligible from the metabolic and ecologic point of view. Results show that behavioural photoprotection might be an energetically cheap mechanism, offering competitive advantages when compared with structural/physiological photoprotection.},

The model results match well with observations and are used to assess processes across tidal to seasonal time scales. During the summer, tidal flat sediments store incoming shortwave radiation during exposure and act effectively as a net source of heat to the water column. This pattern changes in the winter, when the flats cool during exposure and act effectively as a net sink of heat. Additionally, during the summer water temperatures at the edge of the flooding front are elevated 5°C above the surface sediment temperatures.

	abstract = {Diatoms are an extraordinarily diverse, evolutionarily successful, and ecologically important group of single-cell algae. Diatoms of the group of the pennates are particularly important in estuarine sedimentary habitats, where they form highly productive microphytobenthos communities that cover extensive areas of intertidal flats. The pennates are capable of directed motility, an evolutionary and unique trait amongst diatoms, which has long been hypothesized to confer a critical adaptive advantage, by enabling these cells to vertically migrate within the photic zone of the sediment and behaviorally regulate light exposure. This study investigated the role of diatom motility on the active regulation of light exposure by developing a model to quantitatively characterize and compare the experienced light environment of individual cells of two life forms of pennate diatoms that inhabit intertidal estuarine sediments: epipelic species, motile cells dominant in fine sediments, and epipsammic species, non-motile or slowly motile cells, that colonize coarser sediments. The conceptual framework of the model was based on the identification and parameterization of the main controlling factors of the light regime perceived by cells inhabiting the two types of sedimentary environments: (i) solar irradiance incident at the sediment surface, determined by the superimposition of the tidal cycle on the day-night cycle; (ii) light attenuation within the sediment; (iii) sediment mixing by tidal currents or bioturbation, repositioning the cells in the sediment column; (iv) cell velocity, as a function of light intensity and of the photoacclimation state of the cells that determines their photosynthetic light preferences. The model was run for realistic scenarios based on published ecological, photophysiological and cellular motility data (light attenuation, mixing depth, photosynthesis light-response curves, cell velocity), simulating (i) the variation in the vertical position of a diatom cell due to vertical migration and (ii) the irradiance level to which it is exposed at each moment. The results confirm the hypothesis that epipelic and epipsammic diatoms experience a significantly different light environment. Vertical migration enables motile species to experience a much less variable light regime, with increased mean daily light doses received. In contrast, non-motile species experience a much more unstable light environment, including the frequent exposure to supersaturating light levels and to periods of prolonged darkness. These results have important ecological significance, as they support the adaptive value of light-driven motility as a form of optimizing photosynthesis and growth, and they identify vertical migration as a niche-construction activity, allowing motile diatoms to regulate the light environment they experience through habitat selection.},

	abstract = {Epipelic diatoms are motile, the locomotive force being generated by the extrusion of carbohydrate-rich exopolymers (EPS). Production rates of EPS, colloidal (water-soluble) carbohydrates, and glucan (a photosynthetic storage product of diatoms) were investigated in axenic cultures, in sediments under laboratory conditions, and in the field. In stationary-phase axenic monocultures of Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula perminuta, and Nitzschia sigma, EPS concentrations significantly increased during darkness. EPS concentrations in darkness corresponded to decreases in glucan concentration. Glucan concentrations increased significantly in illuminated cultures, Identical patterns of concentration changes were observed in intact diatom-dominated sediments. Inorganic 14C incorporation was used to determine rates of production and flux of photoassimilates through the different carbohydrate fractions in intact sediments. Biofilms exhibited endogenous rhythms of primary and carbohydrate production under laboratory conditions in the absence of tidal influence and under constant illumination (200 µmol m−2 s−1). Maximum production (27.7 mg C m−2 h−1) occurred during periods when sediments would have been emersed had they remained in the field, with 8.0, 3.0, and 0.8\% of photoassimilates being incorporated into colloidal-S, glucan, and EPS, respectively. Higher rates of primary production were measured under natural illumination (617 µmol m−2 s−1) in the field (82.7 mg C m−2 h−1), but the maximum incorporation into colloidal-S, glucan, and EPS was similar (10.9, 2.8, and 1.0\%, respectively). Pulse experiments revealed that 14C initially incorporated into glucan was subsequently reallocated into EPS. Increases in labeled EPS occurred up to 4 h after 14C incorporation, coinciding with periods of migratory activity linked to impending tidal immersion. Production of EPS by epipelic diatoms therefore appears to be closely linked to migratory rhythms, During periods of photosynthesis, assimilated carbon is stored as intracellular glucan, as well as being utilized to produce EPS. A number of stimuli increase the production of EPS: dim light, darkness, and migration linked to tidal immersion. Such increases in EPS production can be met either by increasing the allocation of photoassimilated carbon from current photosynthesis or by reallocating an internal carbon source. This short-term variability in EPS production has implications for our understanding of estuarine carbon budgets and biogenic stabilization of sediments.},

	abstract = {Abstract Heat waves are a major cause of weather-related deaths. With the current concern for global warming it is reasonable to suppose that they may increase in frequency, severity, duration, or areal extent in the future. However, in the absence of an adequate definition of a heat wave, it is impossible to assess either changes in the past or possible consequences for the future. A set of definitions is proposed here, based on the criteria for heat stress forecasts developed by the National Weather Service (NWS). Watches or warnings are issued when thresholds of daytime high and nighttime low heat index (Hi) values are exceeded for at least two consecutive days. The heat index is a combination of ambient temperature and humidity that approximates the environmental aspect of the thermal regime of a human body, with the NWS thresholds representing a generalized estimate of the onset of physiological stress. These thresholds cannot be applied directly nationwide. In hot and humid regions, physical, social, and cultural adaptations will require that the thresholds be set higher to ensure that only those events perceived as stressful are identified. In other, cooler, areas the NWS criteria may never be reached even though unusually hot events may be perceived as heat waves. Thus, it is likely that a similar number of perceived heat events will occur in all regions, with the thresholds varying regionally. Hourly Hi for 178 stations in the coterminous United States was analyzed for the 1951–90 period to determine appropriate threshold criteria. Use of the NWS criteria alone indicated that much of the nation had less than three heat waves per decade, and this value was adopted as the baseline against which to establish suitable thresholds. For all areas, a percentile threshold approach was tested. Using all available data, daytime high and nighttime low thresholds were established separately for each specific percentile. Heat waves were treated as occurring when conditions exceeded both the daytime high and the nighttime low thresholds of the same percentile for two consecutive days. Several thresholds were tested. For much of the South, 1\% thresholds produced appropriate values. Consequently, a heat wave was defined as a period of at least 48 h during which neither the overnight low nor the daytime high Hi falls below the NWS heat stress thresholds (80° and 105°F, respectively), except at stations for which more than 1\% of both the annual high and low Hi observations exceed these thresholds, in which case the 1\% values are used as the heat wave thresholds. As an extension, “hot spells” were similarly defined, but for events falling between the 1\% values and NWS thresholds, with “warm spells” occurring between the 2\% and 1\% values. Again, stations for which the 1\% or 2\% Hi values exceed the NWS thresholds were given modified definitions. The preliminary investigation of the timing and location of heat waves resulting from these definitions indicated that they correctly identified major epidemiological events. A tentative climatic comparison also suggests that heat waves are becoming less frequent in the southern and more frequent in the midwestern and eastern parts of the nation.},

	abstract = {The Seine estuary illustrates the alterations to estuaries due to human activities heavy releases of pollutants of various origins and significant morphological changes beginning in the middle of the 19th century. The intertidal mudflat surface has been seriously reduced ({\textless} 30km2) since the channels of the Seine River came under management. While the role of the Seine estuary in the dynamics of the eastern English Channel ecosystem is recognized as important, the biological characteristics of the estuary remained relatively unknown until the 1990s. Biological diversity was progressively impoverished from the polyhaline zone to the oligohaline zone. In spite of a heavily contaminated environment, the macrobenthic and planktonic fauna of the Seine estuary remains similar to those of other northeastern Atlantic estuaries. The fauna exhibit clear contrasts between areas with very high abundance and others with very low abundance. The pelagic fauna, especially the copepod Eurytemora affinisand the shrimp Palaemon longirostris, are more abundant in the Seine estuary than in other estuaries. Diversified and abundant, Abra alba-Pectinaria koreni and Macoma balthica benthic communities occur, respectively, in the outer and inner parts of the estuary. In subtidal flats, benthic fauna is especially poor in terms of specific richness, abundance and biomass. Paradoxically, considering the high abundance of prey, fish are particularly scarce. Two food webs have been identified. In the oligohaline zone, where turbidity is maximum, the food web is exclusively planktonic, due to dredging that prevented benthic fauna from settling. In the polyhaline zone, fish populations that feed particularly on benthic fauna benefit from low turbidity and high oxygen concentrations. So, in spite of heavy organic and metallic contamination and human activities, the Seine estuary remains a highly productive ecosystem, which provides a nursery for marine fish and feeding grounds for migratory birds. A global management plan appears to be necessary in order to guarantee that the Seine estuary continues to function as it currently does.},

They use it to respond to a wide range of environmental factors, actively exploiting spatial heterogeneities and, under endogenous control, to anticipate changing environmental conditions. In benthic communities dominated by raphid diatoms, rhythms in cell motility determine the patterns of primary productivity and the associated production of extracellular polymeric substances, promoting the biostabilization of sediments. Directed motility is believed to have conferred a critical adaptive advantage to raphid pennate species, explaining their evolutionary success and their fast diversification, resulting in the most recent and the most diverse group of diatoms. However, directed motility is not restricted to the pennates. Planktonic centric species undergo vertical migrations across large distances in the upper layers of the water column, causing vertical fluxes of nutrients and facilitating primary productivity in vast regions of the ocean. This work reviews the current knowledge on the forms of motility in diatoms, their underlying mechanisms, and the factors that control cell motility under natural conditions, considering the possible adaptive advantages and ecological consequences.},

La zone d'étude choisie est une baie à caractère conchylicole de la façade atlantique, la baie de Bourgneuf (47ʿN ; 2ʿW). Le microphytobenthos est composé d'organismes unicellulaires photosynthétiques vivant dans les premiers millimètres de sédiments et largement dominés en baie de Bourgneuf par les Diatomées. La télédétection visible-infrarouge permet l'étude de ces peuplements à partir de leurs caractéristiques spectrales liées à la présence de pigments et mesurées par des radiomètres de terrain et aéroportés. Toutefois, l'interprétation de ces données radiométriques nécessite une connaissance du terrain. Une étude descriptive de la structure du microphytobenthos basée sur un suivi spatial et temporel, a été mise en place durant 15 mois en baie de Bourgneuf. Il apparaît une structuration spatiale des peuplements liée à la granulométrie et à une absence de variabilité saisonnière de la biomasse. Des mesures radiométriques sont réalisées in situ et en laboratoire (cultures monospécifiques) afin d'établir un lien avec les analyses pigmentaires des organismes mesurées en Chromatographie Liquide Haute Pression (CLHP). La biomasse du microphytobenthos est alors estimée à partir des réflectances mesurées à 632 nm (bande d'absorption de la chlorophylle c) dans une gamme de valeurs allant jusqu'à 200 mg Chl a. M-2. Une cartographie du microphytobenthos a été réalisée par les calibrations de six images multispectrales (SPOT) et d'une image hyperspectrale (DAIS) à partir de ces mêmes mesures radiométriques. Ainsi, il apparaît que les peuplements du microphytobenthos se développent le long d'une bande orientée nord-sud en bas d'estran, au niveau de l'isobathe +2 m et pouvant occuper jusqu'à 25 \% de la surface étudiée. La calibration de l'image DAIS permet de bien différentier les microalgues des macroalgues. Les plus fortes biomasses microphytobenthiques cartographiées à partir de cette image sont de l'ordre de 60 mg Chl a. M-2 pour des pixels de 5x5 m.},

The main objective of the current study was to develop a remote sensing based method to measure microphytobenthos (MPB) primary production from intertidal mudflats. This was achieved by coupling hyperspectral radiometry (reflectance, ρ and second derivative, δδ) and PAM-fluorometry (non-sequential light curves, NSLC) measurements. The latter allowed the estimation of primary production using a light use efficiency parameter (LUE) and electron transport rates (ETR) whereas ρ allowed to estimate pigment composition and optical absorption cross-section (a*). Five MPB species representative of the main growth forms: epipelic (benthic motile), epipsammic (benthic motile and non motile) and tychoplanktonic (temporarily resuspended in the water column) were submitted to increasing light intensities from dark to 1950 μmol photons.m-2.s-1. Different fluorescence patterns were observed for the three growth-forms and were linked to their xanthophyll cycle (de-epoxydation state). After spectral reflectance measurements, a* was retrieved using a radiative transfer model and several radiometric indices were tested for their capacity to predict LUE and ETR measured by PAM-fluorometry. Only one radiometric index was not species or growth-form specific, i.e. δδ496/508. This index was named MPBLUE and could be used to predict LUE and ETR. The applicability of this index was tested with simulated bands of a wide variety of hyperspectral sensors at spectral resolutions between 3 and 15 nm of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM).},

	abstract = {In France, oyster aquaculture has been historically developed in intertidal zones, with shellfish farming areas covering much of the Atlantic coast. Monitoring these off-bottom cultures where oysters are grown in plastic mesh-bags set on trestle tables is mandatory for the maritime administration to check compliance with a Structural Plan Document (SPD), while also being important for stock assessment in relation to carrying capacity issues. However, traditional monitoring methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and inefficient in covering large intertidal areas. In this study, we used a new GIS-based analytical method to assess the potential of high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral data to retrieve spatial information on oyster-farming structures using Bourgneuf Bay (France) as a case-study. A non-parametric machine learning algorithm was applied to four UAV flight orthomosaics collected at different altitudes (12, 30, 50, and 120 m) to identify oyster mesh-bags. These supervised classifications achieved overall accuracies above 95\% for all tested altitudes. In addition, an accurate distinction of oyster-bag mesh sizes (4, 9 and 14 mm) was obtained for 12–50 m flights, but there was a lower accuracy at 120 m. Across all flights, the 4 mm mesh size was the least well detected (72.14\% Producer Accuracy). This information can be used to identify bags with specific mesh-sizes used for spat or adult grow out. Finally, we accurately measured oyster table heights using a high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry. The 50 m flight was suggested as the best compromise to obtain precise measurements of the oyster table heights while covering larger areas than lower altitude flights. This demonstrates that UAV technology can provide a set of spatial variables relevant for shellfish farmers and coastal managers in an efficient, rapid, and non-destructive way to monitor the extent and characteristics of oyster-farming areas regularly.},

	abstract = {Seagrass meadows are monitored in the frame of several environmental programs worldwide, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD), to evaluate the ecological status of European coastal and transitional water bodies. The large size, spatial complexity, and interannual variability of seagrass ecosystems significantly challenge field monitoring. In this study, a multi-mission satellite time-series was used to estimate long-term changes in seagrass status in a macrotidal system dominated by Zostera noltei, at Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). Metrics of seagrass extent and density were obtained from Earth Observation (EO) using validated and inter-calibrated Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel2 data from 1985 to 2020. The information provided by satellite data made it possible to compute and compare several seagrass indicators currently in use in several European countries (France, Portugal and UK) within the WFD. Both the seagrass extent and meadow-averaged density displayed increasing trends since 1985. A time-series of merged observations from various satellites revealed a high degree of interannual variability in seagrass extent, with abrupt losses (up to 50\% within one year) alternating with periods of slow recovery (typically 4–6 years). The seagrass meadow which was in a moderate status (sensu the WFD) in the 1980s, achieved an overall recurrent good or high status since the mid-1990s. Altogether, the methods and results presented here demonstrated that EO is a reliable source of information for mapping and assessing the status of intertidal seagrass, complementing in situ measurements by providing long-term, spatial view and standardized observation framework. We recommend the systematic use of EO time-series in complement to traditional field measurements in seagrass monitoring programs such as the WFD.},

The proposed modification has the desirable characteristic of being invariant with respect to photometric distortions. Since the resulting similarity measure is a nonlinear function of the warp parameters, we develop two iterative schemes for its maximization, one based on the forward additive approach and the second on the inverse compositional method. As it is customary in iterative optimization, in each iteration the nonlinear objective function is approximated by an alternative expression for which the corresponding optimization is simple. In our case we propose an efficient approximation that leads to a closed form solution (per iteration) which is of low computational complexity, the latter property being particularly strong in our inverse version. The proposed schemes are tested against the forward additive Lucas-Kanade and the simultaneous inverse compositional algorithm through simulations. Under noisy conditions and photometric distortions our forward version achieves more accurate alignments and exhibits faster convergence whereas our inverse version has similar performance as the simultaneous inverse compositional algorithm but at a lower computational complexity.},

	abstract = {Sediment dwelling, microscopic primary producers, that occupy sediments in the photic zone, are commonly referred to as microphytobenthos (MPB). The MPB are essential components of soft-sediment systems, but are often overlooked when assessing coastal ecosystem functionality and service delivery. The MPB are involved in several complex interactions and feedback that underpin the delivery of vital ecosystem services. MPB profoundly influence the flow and cycling of carbon and nutrients, such as nitrogen, directly and indirectly underpinning highly productive shallow water marine food webs. The MPB can also stabilize sediments through the formation of biofilms, and significantly improve water quality by mediating the benthic–pelagic coupling of nutrients, sediment and pollutants. The functional role of the MPB is compromised by increasing anthropogenic pressures such as nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, herbicides and emerging contaminants such as microplastic pollution. However, MPB are extremely good at buffering the effects of these land-sourced stressors at the interface between land and sea. Synthesis. Society often appreciates the final provisioning of goods and services from our coastal marine environments. However, provisioning services are only possible due to the multitude of supporting and regulating services that underpin them. Microphytobenthos (MPB) are central to benthic ecological networks, and contribute to ecosystem service delivery through various pathways. Understanding the critical role of MPB in complex networks is therefore essential to appreciate their importance in ecosystem function and service delivery into the future.},

This study investigated the feeding behavior of the Paciﬁc oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) relative to a natural microphytobenthic assemblage and the effect on the structure of this assemblage. Oysters were fed only benthic microalgae collected on the intertidal mud ﬂats of Bourgneuf Bay (France) at a suspended particulate matter concentration above the threshold of pseudofeces production. All species in the assemblage were endemic diatoms characteristic of tidal mud ﬂat environments. Four dominant ones, which were all solitary cells with spear-shaped frustules [Navicula ammophila (Grunow), Navicula rostellata (Ku¨tzing), Plagiotropis lepidoptera (Kuntze), and Staurophora amphioxys (Mann)] represented more than 95\% of the 16 species involved. Analysis of feeding processes showed that the retention of the four main diatoms was not signiﬁcantly different, but that two species, the smallest (N. ammophila [22 ؋ 4 ␮m]) and the largest (P. lepidoptera [60 ؋ 15 ␮m]), were preferentially ingested. The study of post-ingestive selection revealed that these two species were also preferentially digested, i.e., preferentially directed into the digestive diverticulum, when they passed through the gut of C. gigas. Cell size and shape did not appear to account for pre-ingestive and post-ingestive selection. The composition of the assemblage was signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by oyster ﬁltration, although the retention rates of the four main species were not signiﬁcantly different. The composition of microalgae in pseudofeces and feces as a result of pre-ingestive and post-ingestive selection differed from that in seawater.},

They obtained their primitive ‘plastids’ from an unknown ancestral cyanobacterium with photosynthetic oxygen-evolving capabilities (Bhattacharya, 1997; Delwiche, 1999; McFadden, 2001; Palmer, 2003; Keeling, 2004a, b). Serial symbioses within heterotrophic hosts gave rise to the present wide diversity of photosynthetic microalgae, which evolved a range of photosynthetic pigments capable of collectively harvesting most of the wavelengths of light available to them in underwater marine habitats (Jeffrey and Wright, 2006). At the present time, the marine phytoplankton contribute at least a quarter of the biomass of the world's vegetation, and constitute the base of the food web that supports either directly or indirectly all the animal populations of the open sea. Some microalgae also contribute significantly to climatic processes, providing nuclei for atmospheric water condensation (Aiken et al., 1992). All microalgae, by their photosynthetic activities, contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide ‘draw-down’ (Jeffrey and Mantoura, 1997), thus helping to ameliorate green-house gases, by removing nearly a third of the anthropogenic carbon released to the atmosphere (Sabine and Feely, 2007).},

	abstract = {In this study the potential of predicting critical erosion shear stresses from microphytobenthos chlorophyll a surface concentrations in the upper mm of the sediment surface was investigated. The results should provide a better basis for estimating sediment surface stability on large scales by means of optical remote sensing. To achieve a comprehensive picture, tidal \#ats in the German and Danish Wadden Sea, which di!ered in tidal range, wave exposure, sediment type and microphytobenthos composition, were studied. The selection of sampling sites was biased towards water-free and visually undisturbed sediment surfaces. The relationship between critical erosion shear stresses and chlorophyll a concentration was found to be highly site-speci"c. Most of the variation within the data set cannot be explained by the chlorophyll a concentration and the surface sediment types present. Instead, the data suggest distinct dependencies on other site speci"c features, such as the intensity of sediment surface reworking, microphytobenthos assemblage composition and the endobenthic macrofauna present. It is concluded that to estimate critical erosion shear stresses from chlorophyll a concentration by means of optical remote sensing techniques requires extensive and repeated site speci"c calibrations since their validity is limited by the patchy and sporadic occurrence of some of the determinant parameters. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Distributions of microphytobenthos are highly heterogeneous at scales as small as a few centimetres. However, the sampling protocols currently used for the absolute determination of microphytobenthos biomass through chlorophyll a concentration measurements in surface sediments are too limited to take this variability into account, typically relying on 3-5 samples taken within a randomly located 1 m2 quadrat in a given environment. We address this issue by objectively and quantitatively inferring the minimum number of samples required to obtain reliable estimates of microphytobenthos biomass on the basis of high-resolution sub-sampling (225 regularly spaced samples) within each of nine 1 m2 quadrats at an unvegetated sheltered intertidal sandbank of the Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia). The results were generalised using data obtained in previous studies on an exposed sandy shore and on sheltered estuarine sandy muds of the Eastern English Channel. Estimates of chlorophyll a concentration exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity, both between and within quadrats. The number of samples needed to estimate the average chlorophyll a concentration, and hence mean microphytobenthos biomass with 95\% confidence intervals, ranged from 15 to 115, and mainly depended on the presence of global and local gradients within the quadrats. These results have major implications for intertidal ecology by implying a possible systematic bias in the measurement of both microphytobenthos biomass and production of up to 40\%. Finally, we emphasise that this issue can be circumvented using field spectrometry or PAM fluorescence measurements coupled with traditional sediment sampling techniques, and urge for unified protocols to be adopted for the routine use of these combined methods.},

They are increasingly used in in situ and remote-sensing applications, detecting algal biomass and major taxa through changes in water colour. This book is a follow-up to the 1997 volume Phytoplankton Pigments in Oceanography (UNESCO Press). Since then, there have been many advances concerning phytoplankton pigments. This book includes recent discoveries on several new algal classes particularly for the picoplankton, and on new pigments. It also includes many advances in methodologies, including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and developments and updates on the mathematical methods used to exploit pigment information and extract the composition of phytoplankton communities. The book is invaluable primarily as a reference for students, researchers and professionals in aquatic science, biogeochemistry and remote sensing.},

Gradients occurred within the domain, and patches were identified close to vegetated areas or within the oyster-farming areas where calm physical conditions and biodeposition altered the sediment and MPB landscapes. Spatial patterns of chl a content were explained primarily by the influence of sediment features, while bed elevation and compaction brought only minor insights into MPB distribution regulation. The smaller size of MPB patches compared to silt patches revealed the interplay between physical structure defining the sediment landscape, the biotic patches that they contain, and that median grain-size is the most important parameter in explaining the spatial pattern of MPB. Small-scale temporal dynamics of sediment chl a content and grain-size distribution were surveyed in parallel during 2 periods of 14 d to detect tidal and seasonal variations. Our results showed a weak relationship between mud fraction and MPB biomass in March, and this relationship fully disappeared in July. Tidal exposure was the most important parameter in explaining the summer temporal dynamics of MPB. This study reveals the general importance of bed elevation and tidal exposure in muddy habitats and that silt content was a prime governing physical factor in winter. Biostabilisation processes seemed to behave only as secondary factors that could only amplify the initial silt accumulation in summer rather than primary factors explaining spatial or long-term trends of sediment changes.},

	abstract = {Benthic diatoms often dominate primary production and contribute to important ecosystem functions on intertidal mudflats. Diatoms fuel the benthic food web and even shape the intertidal landscape by producing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which improve the sediment’s resistance to erosion. Experiments indicate that these communities are likely to be sensitive to increased temperatures and more frequent heat stress, corresponding to predicted effects of climate change. In the present study, we tested the effect of a simulated heat wave on mudflat diatoms. Homogenous sediment cores were constructed in the lab using diatom-rich sediment collected on the intertidal mudflat in the Wadden Sea. In a climate chamber, we exposed the cores to a diurnal cycle simulating natural temperature fluctuations for six days, where half of the cores repeatedly experienced moderate temperatures (Control) and the other half experienced a daily increase in peak temperatures (Heatwave). Fluorescence decreased in all samples over time but showed significantly greater decline in the cores exposed to increasing temperatures. However, we detected no significant changes in chlorophyll a or EPS concentrations between the temperature treatments. The results demonstrate that intense heat stress inhibited productivity, but that further study is needed to understand how rising temperatures may change the structure and stability of intertidal mudflat communities.},

In this study, we analyzed the rapidly growing scientific literature dealing with heat waves. No summarizing overview has been published on this literature hitherto. We developed a suitable search query to retrieve the relevant literature covered by the Web of Science (WoS) as complete as possible and to exclude irrelevant literature (n = 8,011 papers). The time evolution of the publications shows that research dealing with heat waves is a highly dynamic research topic, doubling within about 5 years. An analysis of the thematic content reveals the most severe heat wave events within the recent decades (1995 and 2003), the cities and countries/regions affected (USA, Europe, and Australia), and the ecological and medical impacts (drought, urban heat islands, excess hospital admissions, and mortality). An alarming finding is that the limit for survivability may be reached at the end of the twenty-first century in many regions of the world due to the fatal combination of rising temperatures and humidity levels measured as “wet-bulb temperature” (WBT). Risk estimation and future strategies for adaptation to hot weather are major political issues. We identified 104 citation classics, which include fundamental early works of research on heat waves and more recent works (which are characterized by a relatively strong connection to climate change).},

	abstract = {Flood inundation models are central components of any flood risk analysis system because they transform the bulk discharge outputs from flood-frequency analyses or rainfall-runoff models into distributed predictions of flood hazard in terms of water depth, inundation extent, and flow velocity. The accuracy of flood hazard maps depends on the availability of distributed observations of inundation outlines. Unfortunately, the acquisition of aerial photographs or satellite images is costly and in addition, their temporal resolution is strongly limited by weather conditions. Remote sensing based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is becoming increasingly popular due its flexibility and quickly decreasing costs. In particular, UAV can provide precise up to date georeferenced information about the location of a river shorelines, channel geometry, and vegetation. This information is particularly useful for the calibration and validation of distributed flood routing models. The application of cheap, well georeferenced UAV images of river shorelines is an unprecedented source of distributed observations. The aim of this article is to present a procedure for the updating of boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model, based on UAV-born data. The approach proposed is also a very effective means of on-line updating of flood risk maps and their verification.},

	abstract = {Topographic and geomorphological surveys of coastal areas usually require the aerial mapping of long and narrow sections of littoral. The georeferencing of photogrammetric models is generally based on the signalization and survey of Ground Control Points (GCPs), which are very time-consuming tasks. Direct georeferencing with high camera location accuracy due to on-board multi-frequency GNSS receivers can limit the need for GCPs. Recently, DJI has made available the Phantom 4 Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) (DJI-P4RTK), which combines the versatility and the ease of use of previous DJI Phantom models with the advantages of a multi-frequency on-board GNSS receiver. In this paper, we investigated the accuracy of both photogrammetric models and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) generated in Agisoft Metashape from two different image datasets (nadiral and oblique) acquired by a DJI-P4RTK. Camera locations were computed with the Post-Processing Kinematic (PPK) of the Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) file recorded by the aircraft during flight missions. A Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) located at a 15 km distance from the site was used for this task. The results highlighted that the oblique dataset produced very similar results, with GCPs (3D RMSE = 0.025 m) and without (3D RMSE = 0.028 m), while the nadiral dataset was affected more by the position and number of the GCPs (3D RMSE from 0.034 to 0.075 m). The introduction of a few oblique images into the nadiral dataset without any GCP improved the vertical accuracy of the model (Up RMSE from 0.052 to 0.025 m) and can represent a solution to speed up the image acquisition of nadiral datasets for PPK with the DJI-P4RTK and no GCPs. Moreover, the results of this research are compared to those obtained in RTK mode for the same datasets. The novelty of this research is the combination of a multitude of aspects regarding the DJI Phantom 4 RTK aircraft and the subsequent data processing strategies for assessing the quality of photogrammetric models, DTMs, and cross-section profiles.},

This research compares the use of drone-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) created from a DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone with airborne LiDAR data to analyze sea-level rise in Essex, Massachusetts. To evaluate the best method of calibrating drone elevation data to the local environment, three different Ground Control Point (GCP) methods were evaluated: surveyed GCPs, LiDAR-derived GCPs, and the NAVD88 sea-level (0-value) of the LiDAR data. The three drone-derived DEMs were compared with a LiDAR DEM through two methods: 1) comparing how well the DEMs measured the elevation of surveyed GCPs, and 2) how well the DEMs modeled five different scenarios of sea level rise compared with a LiDAR DEM. Results showed that two of the calibration methods performed well; the surveyed GCP derived drone DEM and the LiDAR NAVD88 sea-level (0-value) derived drone DEM.},

	title = {Etude de la pertinence des peuplements du microphytobenthos estuarien pour la mise en place d'un bio-indicateur de la qualité des eaux de transition},
	abstract = {In order to establish the ecological status of transitional water bodies, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is based on the evaluation of a certain number of biological quality elements, as well as physicochemical parameters supporting biology. As phytoplankton monitoring is not considered relevant due to the high turbidity characterizing the large estuaries in mainland France and overseas departments (French Guiana), the possibility of using microphytobenthos as a biological indicator of the ecological status of estuaries is being explored as a possible alternative. 

This activity report presents all the work carried out in 2021 within the framework of an OFB / University of Nantes agreement concerning estuarine microphytobenthos, summarizes all the work carried out since the start of the project and concludes the project.

This work is divided into two parts. The first part concerns the micro-scale study (cm2) based on variations in the diversity and biomass of communities in relation to natural and anthropogenic pressures. The objective is to explore the possibility of developing a bio-indicator of the quality of estuarine water which draws inspiration from work carried out for freshwater. In 2021, we analyzed the data collected during the 2018 field campaigns in the estuaries of La Penzé, Morlaix, and the Seine. We related the data of microphytobenthos biomass estimated by the concentration of chlorophyll-a, also adding the data from 2016. We were able to identify the role of nutrients and secondarily macrofauna. The highest biomasses were observed for the site with the highest concentrations of ammonium, phosphates, and silicates. This confirmed the idea put forward in the article by Oiry \& Barillé (2021) of microphytobenthos as a bioindicator of nutrient concentrations, in particular ammonium and nitrates. With this in mind, we wrote a manuscript describing an ecological niche-based method to identify which taxa have the best bioindication potential for nitrates and ammonium. The principle was outlined in last year's report (Oiry et al. 2020). We therefore now have the ability to assign an indicator value and ecological sensitivity to taxa of microphytobenthos by analogy with what is done for freshwater. We are, however, limited by the available dataset, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than what exists in freshwater. The range of environmental data, in particular nutrients, does not reach the values described for highly anthropized European estuaries. We, therefore, believe that we have laid the foundations to develop a bio-indicator based microphytobenthos communities.
The last objective of the micro-scale actions was to update the database of benthic diatoms in mainland France. The current database includes 11,511 taxonomic entries found in 49 different references. The time period of the references used in this database now extends from 1888 to 2019. We have reconfigured the data in the Darwin Core Archive format, which is a standard for computer data on biodiversity. This will allow the database to be uploaded to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, https://www.gbif.org/) and to prepare a publication in the Biodiversity Data Journal (https://bdj.pensoft.net ).

The second part concerns the macro-scale (km2) study of the microphytobenthos (MPB) using satellite remote sensing. We continued the observation of the MPB of the 42 Transitional Water Bodies (TWB) using the Sentinel-2 constellation of the European Space Agency which had been carried out for the year 2018 (Oiry \& Barillé, 2021). This year we analyzed all the images available for 2019 and 2020, and therefore had 3 years of data. For each TWB and each date available, the biomass of MPB (estimated by the NDVI vegetation index) and the \% cover of intertidal zones by MPB were recovered. Thus for each TWB, the frequency distribution of these two variables was obtained. We thus determined the 90 percentile (P90) of these two variables for each TWB. TWBs composed mainly of sandy sediments were treated separately from those composed mainly of muddy sediments. The median P90 for each estuary was compared to a reference P90 selected from estuaries that had the lowest median concentrations of nitrogenous nutrients from the Naïades platform (naiades.eaufrance.fr). An Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) is thus proposed which combines the two metrics with a weighing principle. The EQR was applied to the 42 TWBs in mainland France.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of earth surface dynamic processes requires global observations of the structure and the functioning of vegetation. Moderate resolution sensors (with pixel size ranging from 250 m to 7 km) provide frequent estimates of biophysical variables to characterize vegetation such as the leaf area index (LAI). However, the computation of LAI from moderate resolution remote sensing data induces a scaling bias on the LAI estimate if the moderate resolution pixel is heterogeneous and if the transfer function that relates remote sensing data to LAI is non-linear. This study provides a model to evaluate and correct the scaling bias. The model is built first for a univariate semi-empirical transfer function relating LAI directly to NDVI. The scaling bias is a function of (i) the degree of non-linearity of the transfer function quantified by its second derivative and (ii) the spatial heterogeneity of the moderate resolution pixel quantified by the variogram of the high spatial resolution (20 m) NDVI image. Then, the model is extended to a bivariate transfer function where LAI is related to red and near infrared reflectances. The scaling bias depends on (i) the Hessian matrix of the transfer function and (ii) the variograms and cross variogram of the red and near infrared reflectances. The scaling bias is investigated on several distinct landscapes from the VALERI database. Adjusting for scaling bias is critical on crop sites which are the most heterogeneous sites at the landscape level. Regarding the univariate transfer function, the magnitude of the scaling bias increases rapidly with pixel size until this size is larger than the typical spatial scale of the data. For the bivariate transfer function, it results from the addition of several components that may add up or cancel each other out. It is thus more difficult to analyze. The accuracy of the model to estimate the scaling bias is discussed. It depends mainly on the ability of the variograms and cross variogram to represent the local dispersion variances and covariance within the moderate resolution pixel. The model is generally highly accurate at 1000 m spatial resolution for the univariate transfer function and less accurate for the bivariate transfer function.},

	abstract = {We argue that geophysical and geographical fields are generally characterised by wide range scaling implying systematic, strong (power law) resolution dependencies when they are remotely sensed. The corresponding geometric structures are fractal sets; the corresponding fields are multifractals. Mathematically, multifractals are measures that are singular with respect to the standard Lebesgue measures; therefore, they are outside the scope of many of the methods of classical geostatistics. Because the resolution of a measurement is generally (due to technical constraints) much larger than the inner scale of the variability/scaling, the observations will be fundamentally observer dependent; hence, standard remote sensing algorithms that do not explicitly take this dependence into account will depend on subjective resolution-dependent parameters. We argue that, on the contrary, the resolution dependence must be systematically removed so that scale-invariant algorithms independent of the observer can be produced. We illustrate these ideas in various ways with the help of eight-channel, 7 m resolution remote ocean colour data (from the MIES II sensor) over the St Lawrence estuary. First, we show that the data is indeed multiscaling over nearly four orders of magnitude in scale, and we quantify this using universal multifractal parameters. With the help of conditional multifractal statistics, we then show how to use multifractals in various practical ways such as for extrapolating from one resolution to another or from one location to another, or to correcting biases introduced when studying extreme, rare phenomena. We also show how the scaling interrelationship of surrogate and in situ data can be handled using vector multifractals and examine the resolution dependence of principle components in dual wavelength analyses. Finally, we indicate why the standard ocean colour algorithms have hidden resolution dependencies, and we show how they can (at least in principle) be removed.},

	abstract = {Imaging spectrometers measure electromagnetic energy scattered in their instantaneous field view in hundreds or thousands of spectral channels with higher spectral resolution than multispectral cameras. Imaging spectrometers are therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higher spectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis, which facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials in scenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial resolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering, spectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus, accurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a few materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of: the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances at each pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because of model inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmember variability, and data set size. Researchers have devised and investigated many models searching for robust, stable, tractable, and accurate unmixing algorithms. This paper presents an overview of unmixing methods from the time of Keshava and Mustard's unmixing tutorial to the present. Mixing models are first discussed. Signal-subspace, geometrical, statistical, sparsity-based, and spatial-contextual unmixing algorithms are described. Mathematical problems and potential solutions are described.

There is, however, a dearth of empirical tests of this hypothesis. This study uses nested NDVI observations acquired from an aircraft-mounted digital camera to assess the spatial properties of measured and rescaled image data. Imagery was collected at four altitudes, yielding spatial resolutions varying from 0.625 m to 3.125 m. The common area from these four images was extracted. The finest spatial resolution image was then rescaled by aggregating pixels to synthesize three rescaled images matching the spatial resolution of the measured images. The spatial properties of these measured and rescaled images were compared, using metrics derived from the variogram. Results demonstrate that the spatial patterns of rescaled data do not correspond to those of the directly observed data. The results suggest that rescaling by averaging blocks of pixels may not adequately preserve spatial properties of very high spatial resolution images and consequent inferred biogeophysical fields.},

The availability of GIS has provided an appropriate environment to re-scale data prior to subsequent integration, but few tools with which to implement the re-scaling. This sparsity of appropriate tools arises primarily because the nature of the spatial variation of interest is often poorly understood and, specifically, the patterns of spatial dependence and error are unknown. Spatial dependence can be represented and modelled using geostatistical approaches providing a basis for the subsequent re-scaling of spatial data (e.g., via spatial interpolation). Geostatistical techniques can also be used to model the effects of re-scaling data through the geostatistical operation of regularization. Regularization provides a means by which to re-scale the statistics and functions that describe the data rather than the data themselves. These topics are reviewed in this paper and the importance of the spatial scale problems that remain is emphasized.},

	abstract = {Heatwaves have increased in intensity, duration and frequency over the last decades due to climate change. Intertidal species, living in a highly variable environment, are likely to be exposed to such heatwaves since they can be emerged for more than 6 h during a tidal cycle. Little is known, however, on how temperature affects species traits (e.g. locomotion and behaviour) of slow-moving organisms such as benthic foraminifera (single-celled protists), which abound in marine sediments. Here, we examine how temperature influences motion-behaviour and metabolic traits of the dominant temperate foraminifera Haynesina germanica by exposing individuals to usual (6, 12, 18, 24, 30 °C) and extreme (high; i.e. 32, 34, 36 °C) temperature regimes. Our results show that individuals reduced their activity by up to 80\% under high temperature regimes whereas they remained active under the temperatures they usually experience in the field. When exposed to a hyper-thermic stress (i.e. 36 °C), all individuals remained burrowed and the photosynthetic activity of their sequestered chloroplasts significantly decreased. Recovery experiments subsequently revealed that individuals initially exposed to a high thermal regime partially recovered when the hyper-thermic stress ceased. H. germanica contribution to surface sediment reworking substantially diminished from 10 mm3 indiv−1 day−1 (usual temperature) to 0 mm3 indiv−1 day−1 when individuals were exposed to high temperature regimes (i.e. above 32 °C). Given their role in sediment reworking and organic matter remineralisation, our results suggest that heatwaves may have profound long-lasting effects on the functioning of intertidal muddy ecosystems and some key biogeochemical cycles.},

	abstract = {Several studies highlighted the occurrence of circular pools in intertidal flats of different coastal systems and their transient water chemistry over both tidal and diurnal cycles. However, little is known about (1) the response of benthic biogeochemical reactions and fluxes at the sediment-water interface over such short time scales, and (2) the role of these tidal pools in the biogeochemical functioning of coastal systems. Based on in situ microprofiles and water sampling, we investigated the dynamics of dissolved oxygen (O2), nutrients, sulfides and metals, and the associated fluxes at the sediment-water interface in tidal pools from the Arcachon Bay (Atlantic coast of France). Our integrative approach included several tidal and diurnal cycles over two different seasons in the presence and absence of Zostera noltei. The results show that water temperature and light irradiance were the main factors driving the biogeochemical functioning of the tidal pools, as they controlled the physiological activity of the microphytobenthos. Changes in light radiations induced diurnal fluctuations of O2 concentrations within surficial sediment, thus resulting in fluctuations of the O2 diffusive fluxes at the sediment-water interface and of the O2 penetration depth in sediment. At high tide, the increase in turbulence above the sediment induced the advection of oxygenated water within the first millimeters of sediment, resulting in a significant increase in porewater O2 concentrations and sediment O2 penetration depth. Porewater sulfide concentrations and apparition depth were concomitant with the O2 dynamic over both diurnal and tidal cycles, indicating that intermediate redox diagenetic processes were impacted by O2 dynamic over such short time-scale. The rapid changes in redox processes in the sediment column are confirmed by a significant flux of dissolved manganese toward the water column during nighttime. The consumption of nitrate and the release of ammonium and phosphate, associated to the mineralization of the organic matter in the surface sediment did not appeared related however to such short time cycles. The efflux of dissolved silica from the sediment was most likely associated with the enhanced dissolution of Si-bearing particles in surface sediment at higher temperatures, although silica uptake by Z. noltei was also noted. This study clearly shows that tidal pools function as natural incubators of transient biogeochemical processes. A rough assessment of the nutrient budget at the scale of the bay indicates the tidal pools may contribute significantly to the biogeochemical functioning of Arcachon Bay.},

While predation in homogeneous environments increases the probability of population extinction, fragmentation/heterogeneity promotes coexistence and enhances community stability as shown by experimentation with animals and microorganisms, and supported by theory. Patch connectivity can modulate such effects but how microbial predatory interactions are affected by water-driven connectivity is unknown. In soil, patch habitability by microorganisms, and their connectivity depend upon the water saturation degree (SD). Here, using the obligate bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, and a Burkholderia prey, we show that soil spatial heterogeneity profoundly affects predatory dynamics, enhancing long-term co-existence of predator and prey in a SD-threshold dependent-manner. However, as patches and connectors cannot be distinguished in these soil matrices, metapopulations cannot be invoked to explain the dynamics of increased persistence. Using a set of experiments combined with statistical and physical models we demonstrate and quantify how under full connectivity, predation is independent of water content but depends on soil microstructure characteristics. In contrast, the SD below which predation is largely impaired corresponds to a threshold below which the water network collapses and water connectivity breaks down, preventing the bacteria to move within the soil matrix.},

The model describes the photosynthetic processes and those connected with photoinhibition and recovery from photoinhibition. In this paper, the steady-state properties of the model are studied and a production curve is derived from it. Simple expressions are derived for the maximum production rate pm, the optimal and characteristic intensities Imand Ik, and the initial slope of the curve. A new dimensionless parameter is introduced that measures the degree of photoinhibition. An interative least-squares algorithm provides an easy method for fitting the parameters of the curve. It is proposed to present production curves in a dimensionless form (p / pm vs I / Im) on logarithmic scales. This is especially useful in comparing different photosynthetic models. Comparison of the curve with those of Vollenweider and Platt et al. shows that they all behave similarly, except at high light intensities. The main advantage of this model compared to empirical curves is its foundation on physiological mechanisms. This makes it possible to derive of temperature in a mechanistic way.

	abstract = {Foraging macrofauna, such as the sand dollar Encope emarginata, can modify sediment properties and affect spatial distribution patterns of microphytobenthos and meiobenthos at different spatial scales. We adopted a spatial hierarchical approach composed of five spatial levels (km, 100. s. m, 10. s. m, 1. s. m and cm) to describe variation patterns of microphytobenthos, meiobenthos and sediment variables in shallow subtidal regions in the subtropical Paranaguá Bay (Southern Brazil) with live E. emarginata (LE), dead E. emarginata (only skeletons - (DE), and no E. emarginata (WE). The overall structure of microphytobenthos and meiofauna was always less variable at WE and much of variation at the scale of 100. s. m was related to variability within LE and DE, due to foraging activities or to the presence of shell hashes. Likewise, increased variability in chlorophyll- a and phaeopigment contents was observed among locations within LE, although textural parameters of sediment varied mainly at smaller scales. Variations within LE were related to changes on the amount and quality of food as a function of sediment heterogeneity induced by the foraging behavior of sand dollars. We provide strong evidence that top-down effects related to the occurrence of E. emarginata act in synergy with bottom-up structuring related to hydrodynamic processes in determining overall benthic spatial variability. Conversely, species richness is mainly influenced by environmental heterogeneity at small spatial scales (centimeters to meters), which creates a mosaic of microhabitats. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos biomass has been measured at several coastal sites on the SE of the main island of the Kerguelen Archipelago (Indian Ocean), during several austral summers (1985-1992), using a conventional fluorometric method. Heterogeneity tests, conducted on two different intertidal sites (Port-Aux-Français, PAF; and Port-Raymond, PRA), showed low standard deviations, whereas the mean concentrations were highly different. Pigment concentrations showed a high variability related to the characteristics of the sediments: from low biomass in coarse intertidal sand, submitted to intense scouring (0.32 ± 0.31 μg Chl a g-1 dw, 0.29 ± 0.14 μg Phaeo g-1 dw) to high biomass in intertidal muddy sand in sheltered areas, particularly along estuaries (54 μg Ch1 a, 15 μg Phaeo g-1 dw at Korrigan). The subtidal muddy sediments under a Macrocystis pyrifera (Linné) and Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso in Choris) belt exhibited high concentrations in phaeopigment (Phaeo) (up to 136 ± 83 μg g-1 dw; PRA), while the concentration of chlorophyll a (Ch1 a) was relatively low. The dense macroalgal canopy supports an important epiphytic diatom biomass (mainly the genera Cocconeis Ehrenberg and Grammatophora Ehrenberg), which is sedimenting after degradation and is in part responsible of the high levels of Phaeo in all sediments. Macroalgal debris were observed, but diatom frustules were dominant in most surficial subtidal sediments. A circatidal mud, in the Morbihan Bay, made of a sponge spicule mat (50 m deep; 4.96 μg Ch1 a g-1 dw), showed a very low Ch1 a/Phaeo ratio (0.1), while it reached up to 6 in intertidal sand. Surprisingly, a penguin rookery beach, at the east side of Courbet Peninsula, was characterized by a very low biomass (0.07 ± 0.04 μg Ch1 a g-1 dw), while it was nutrient enriched, particularly with nitrates. In comparison with the data at the similar latitude, but in temperate regions from the Northern Hemisphere, the microphytobenthos biomass, recorded at Kerguelen's Land, exhibited relatively high pigment concentrations, particularly the Phaeo, and supported a dense and diversified subtidal macrofauna composed of polychaetes (particularly Thelepus extensus Hutchings and Glasby), sea urchins, mytillids and gammarids. The exuberant macroalgal canopy, coastal indentations and low tidal amplitude must be in part responsible of these large benthic primary and secondary biomasses. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sequential ERS-2 SAR and Envisat MERIS-FR data were used to derive synoptic changes in intertidal bottom mud and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the top of the water column, respectively. These satellite data were combined with in situ measurements and with a high resolution three-dimensional cohesive sediment model, simulating mud transport, resuspension, settling and deposition under the influence of tides, wind, waves and freshwater discharge. The spatial distribution of both bottom mud and SPM as observed by in situ and satellite techniques was largely explained by modelled estuarine circulation, tidal and wind-induced variations in vertical mixing and horizontal advection. The three data sources also showed similar spring-neap and seasonal variations in SPM (all factor 1.5 to 2), but semi-diurnal tidal variations were underestimated by the model. Satellite data revealed that changes in intertidal bottom mud were spatially heterogeneous, but on average mud content doubled during summer, which was confirmed by in situ data. The model did not show such seasonal variation in bed sediment, suggesting that seasonal dynamics are not well explained by the physical factors presently implemented in the model, but may be largely attributed to other (internal) factors, including increased floc size in summer, temporal stabilisation of the sediment by microphytobenthos and a substantially lower roughness of the intertidal bed in summer as observed by the satellite. The effects of such factors on estuarine mud dynamics were evaluated. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

	abstract = {Shallow coastal lagoons, especially the ones with clear waters and lighted substrata, are likely to have large microphytobenthos (MPB) communities. MPB is an important component of these systems, representing up to 99\% of the chlorophyll concentration when compared to phytoplankton. It is therefore expected that MPB resuspension play a key role in the dynamics of phytoplankton due to the tide and wind action. Water samples were collected twice per month inside and outside Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal), for nutrients and chlorophyll a (chl a). Sediment samples were also collected for MPB chl a. Chl a was also analysed in water and sediment samples from Venice lagoon (Italy), at least once per month. A truncated Fourier series was fitted to the data to investigate the seasonal and high-frequency components of the time-series. In the Ria Formosa, the best significant fit for MPB was obtained considering the sum of 26 wave-pairs (sin and cosine), which explained 31\% of the variability. The seasonal cycle (1-3 waves) explained approximately 5\% of the total variability. Within-day variability which includes spatial heterogeneity explained 61\% of the variability. The best fit for phytoplankton inside Ria Formosa was obtained considering the sum of 23 wave-pairs. Outside the lagoon the best fit was obtained using only the sum of 16 wave-pairs. For both cases, the sum of waves explained more than 64\% of the variability and the seasonal cycle explained more than 31\% of the variability. It is expected that primary producers in the water column have a strong seasonal factor due to the direct effect of the solar cycle, which is the case of other clear waters. In the Venice lagoon, which is microtidal, the best fit for MPB was obtained using 10 wave-pairs. However, the best fit for phytoplankton was obtained with only 3 wave-pairs, indicating the importance of the seasonal cycle. Significant relationships were found between phytoplankton inside and outside the Ria Formosa, as well as between microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in the lagoons of Venice and Ria Formosa. These results suggest the influence of MPB resuspension in the phytoplankton community of shallow coastal lagoons and the importance of phytoplankton exportation to the coastal zone. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Coastal food webs can be supported by local benthic or pelagic primary producers and by the import of organic matter. Distinguishing between these energy sources is essential for our understanding of ecosystem functioning. However, the relative contribution of these components to the food web at the landscape scale is often unclear, as many studies lack good taxonomic and spatial resolution across large areas. Here, using stable carbon isotopes, we report on the primary carbon sources for consumers and their spatial variability across one of the world's largest intertidal ecosystems (Dutch Wadden Sea; 1460 km2 intertidal surface area), at an exceptionally high taxonomic (178 species) and spatial resolution (9,165 samples from 839 locations). The absence of overlap in δ13C values between consumers and terrestrial organic matter suggests that benthic and pelagic producers dominate carbon input into this food web. In combination with the consistent enrichment of benthic primary producers (δ13C −16.3‰) relative to pelagic primary producers (δ13C −18.8) across the landscape, this allowed the use of a two-food-source isotope-mixing model. This spatially resolved modelling revealed that benthic primary producers (microphytobenthos) are the most important energy source for the majority of consumers at higher trophic levels (worms, molluscs, crustaceans, fish, and birds), and thus to the whole food web. In addition, we found large spatial heterogeneity in the δ13C values of benthic primary producers (δ13C −19.2 to −11.5‰) and primary consumers (δ13C −25.5 to −9.9‰), emphasizing the need for spatially explicit sampling of benthic and pelagic primary producers in coastal ecosystems. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the functioning of ecological networks and for the management of coastal ecosystems. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America},

	abstract = {Benthic diatoms form an important component of the microphytobenthos and have long been utilised as suitable bioindicators in aquatic systems. However, knowledge on benthic diatom community succession on hard substrata (biofilm) remains understudied in austral marine coastal systems. In this study, we investigated benthic diatom colonisation on artificial substrates (Plexiglass) over a period of 5 weeks at two locations with different physical environments along the warm temperate coast of South Africa. Results revealed relatively similar physico-chemical conditions but highly contrasting diatom community development were observed between the two sites. While there were some shared taxa, site-specific dynamics resulted in significantly different diatom species diversity and richness, facilitated by common (e.g., Nitzschia ventricosa and Cocconeis scutellum) and a large percentage of rarely observed species such as Cocconeis testudo and Lyrella lyra. A total of 134 species belonging to 44 genera were observed during the study. The overall diatom composition differed spatio-temporally during the experimental period, with the fluctuating species occurrences and abundances highlighting the rapid microalgal species turnover within days, under natural conditions. Environmental variables were shown to have varying influences as drivers of the diatom community descriptors. Multivariate modelling confirmed that study site and the interaction between site and sampling occasion were important predictors of diatom abundances, and the overall observed community composition. The current results suggest that benthic diatoms on artificial substrata could be incorporated as suitable indicators of change along the coastline subject to further investigations, taking into account site-specific differences driven by habitat complexity and environmental variability. The experimental method proved to be efficient and can be implemented to study the response of benthic diatoms to localised nutrient enrichment around the coastline.

	abstract = {The summer of 2012/2013 signified the end of the dry phase in the St Lucia estuarine system that lasted for over a decade. The increased rainfall coupled with the partial re-connection of the Mfolozi River to the estuarine system shifted St Lucia to a new limnetic state. With the increased availability of habitat due to the higher water level, it was expected that microalgal biomass and abundance would rapidly increase through recruitment from refuge areas i.e. South Lake and new introductions. Microalgal and physico-chemical data were collected at three sites within the Mfolozi/Msunduzi River and at 23 sites within the St Lucia estuarine system between June 2014 and February 2015. Results from this study indicated low biomass for both phytoplankton ({\textless}5 μg l−1) and microphytobenthos ({\textless}60 mg m−2) because of local and external drivers. These included limited nutrient and light availability, variable water residence times, biomass dilution and heterogeneity of the sediment. The high spatio-temporal variability limits the effectiveness of using the microalgal communities to detect change in the estuarine lake. In addition, significant intrasystem differences were observed between the three main lake basins and Narrows, due to the influence of the freshwater input from the Mfolozi River. This study provides insight into the spatio-temporal variability of physico-chemical conditions and microalgal communities during the 2014–2015 limnetic state. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Intertidal macroalgae can modulate their biophysical environment by ameliorating physical conditions and creating habitats. Exploring how seaweed aggregations made up of different species at different densities modify the local environment may help explain how associated organisms respond to the attenuation of extreme physical conditions. Using Silvetia compressa, Chondracanthus canaliculatus, and Pyropia perforata, we constructed monocultures representing the leathery, corticated and foliose functional forms as well as a mixed tri-culture assemblage including the former three, at four densities. Treatment quadrats were installed in the intertidal where we measured irradiance, temperature, particle retention, and water motion underneath the canopies. Additionally, we examined the abundance and richness of the understory microphytobenthos with settlement slides. We found that the density and species composition of the assemblages modulated the amelioration of extreme physical conditions, with macroalgal aggregations of greater structural complexity due to their form and density showing greater physical factor attenuation. However, increasing the number of species within a patch did not directly result in increased complexity and therefore, did not necessarily cause greater amelioration of the environment. Microphytobenthic composition was also affected by species composition and density, with higher abundances under S. compressa and C. canaliculatus canopies at high and mid densities. These results support the idea that the environmental modifications driven by these macroalgae have a significant effect on the dynamics of the intertidal environment by promoting distinct temporal and spatial patchiness in the microphytobenthos, with potentially significant effects on the overall productivity of these ecosystems. © 2017 Phycological Society of America},

	abstract = {A study on spatio-temporal distribution of microphytobhethos in intertidal zones of Tagus Estuary was carried out from 1990 to 1992. Near Lisbon, Portugal, Tagus Estuary is a shallow mesotidal estuary, covering an area of 320 km2. The intertidal area ranges from 20 to 40\% off the total area and it is constituted mainly by mudflats. Intertidal flats are richly populated by microalgae, diatoms being the most important and ubiquitos group. Spatial variation of microphytobethos was studied in spring 1990, 21 different sites were sampled. Microphytobenthos biomass was evaluated as chlorophyll a content of the surface centimeter, ranging from 10 to 240 mg m-2. A Principal Component Analysis showed that 62\% of the total variability found in intertidal flats of Tagus estuary could be attributed to two major factors: sediment type and tidal height. A hierarchical grouping defined 3 major groups of similar stations, each one representing a different strata of the ecosystem. One station from each group was chosen for the study of the temporal variation. A sampling, rogram took place from April 1991 to April 1992, with fortnightly sampling, the Chl a ranged from 20-300 mg m-2. No clear seasonal variation was found, and our results indicated that tidal height of sampledsite played an essential role in temporal biomass evolution, thus upper littoral sites were influenced by climatic parameters, whereas in lower sites action of tides mainly controlled microphytic biomass. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

It examines MPB community responses to environmental variables and further investigates MPB composition qualitatively across different micro-estuaries and micro-outlets over four seasons in a warm temperate region of the subcontinent. Combinations of multivariate analyses were used to explore similarities and differences in MPB communities between systems. Human-induced catchment changes between microsystems ranged from no alteration (rating 0; mostly micro-outlets) to extreme modification (rating 5; mostly micro-estuaries). Two hundred and sixty-seven MPB taxa were identified within all the microsystems, with 247 and 230 MPB taxa being observed in the micro-estuaries and micro-outlets, respectively. The MPB communities differed slightly in terms of microsystem types and seasons, but no significant differences were observed. Multivariate analyses (i.e. Boosted Regression Trees, Canonical Correspondence Analysis) showed that water column variables were significant and important in structuring MPB communities, with soluble reactive phosphorus, sediment pH, turbidity, ammonium and temperature being documented as key drivers. The MPB community composition clearly reflected the influence of catchment anthropogenic activities on species composition and structure. Moderately modified catchments resulted in MPB community structure variation among water bodies in relationship to land use and salinity gradients. The study found that; (i) by virtue of their size, microsystems and their catchments are likely to be particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures when compared to systems of larger size; (ii) a typical impacted state may reflect reduced environmental heterogeneity which, compared to larger systems, may be achieved over much shorter time periods (following a particular event) or under much less intensive impacts; and (iii) the response in terms of MPB structure may predictably reflect a concomitant change from a complex community dynamic (structure and spatio-temporal attributes) to one that approaches a homogeneous structure (poor spatial zonation, strong taxonomic dominance, low species diversity). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography to quantify taxon-specific pigments, I investigated habitat-linked heterogeneity in microphytobenthic biomass, composition, and diversity within two natural wetland systems from southern California and tested for differences in community structure between natural and restored ecosystems. Natural vegetated habitat at Mission Bay had higher concentrations of zeaxanthin (cyanobacteria) and bacteriochlorophyll a (anoxygenic photobacteria) than unvegetated mudflat and creek banks. Organic matter was positively correlated with the concentrations of these pigments, whereas sediment pore water salinity and sand content were generally unrelated to composition. At Tijuana Estuary, community structure was generally similar between mudflat and Spartina marsh at the natural site, but concentrations of chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin (diatoms) were higher in mudflats. Restored wetland similarity with adjacent natural habitat (age 2 yr at Tijuana Estuary and 6 yr at Mission Bay) depended on habitat type and pigment measure. Restored upper intertidal succulent marsh at Mission Bay was most divergent: it had lower microalgal biomass, a lower concentration of zeaxanthin relative to fucoxanthin, and less bacteriochlorophyll a relative to chlorophyll a than natural habitat. The results suggest that patches of prokaryotic primary producers coincide with areas of high sediment organic matter and/or hypoxia superimposed on a broadly distributed flora of diatoms across various wetland landscapes. © 2009 The Society of Wetland Scientists.},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB), the photosynthetic primary producing component of microbenthos, shows variable patterns in its biomass distribution along the intertidal gradient as a result of the interactions of factors such as light, tides, temperature, and grazing pressure. These patterns have been studied more extensively in northern European estuaries than southern European coastal systems. Even less information is available regarding temporal changes in MPB primary production rates in these systems. For this reason, we followed the seasonal changes in net production in light and dark respiration rates (determined by oxygen microelectrodes) and MPB biomass (estimated by sediment chlorophyll a) along the intertidal gradient of the inner Cadiz Bay during a year. Sediment cores were collected along two transects (five sampling stations per transect) with distinct sediment granulometry: one muddy [Puerto Real (PR)] and one muddy-sandy transect [San Fernando (SF)]. Our results show that MPB biomass and net production increased seawards reaching their maxima in winter. In contrast to what is observed in northern European systems, the higher solar irradiance and temperatures occurring in summer in southern Spain likely inhibit MPB production. In Cadiz Bay, spatial patterns of MPB biomass and net production depended on season and location due to the environmental heterogeneity observed. Environmental variables, analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), were used to explain the variability of MPB metabolism by multiple regression. Selected principal component (PC) axes explained 60\% of the net production in light and 41\% of the dark respiration rates variability in PR, while they only accounted for 25\% of the same rates in SF. The differences observed between transects and the variability in the environmental variables explaining them highlight the importance of considering the spatial heterogeneity of our system to estimate the contribution of MPB to the inner Cadiz Bay productivity. In our case, this contribution is significant accounting for up to 49\% of the total benthic production of the inner Cadiz Bay intertidal sediments, confirming previous global estimates. © Copyright © 2020 Haro, Lara, Laiz, González, Bohórquez, Garcia-Robledo, Corzo and Papaspyrou.},

	abstract = {Responses by organisms to topographic amelioration of the environment are often assumed to represent direct associations between organisms and topographic features of rocky shores. Responses can also be indirect. For example, differences in environmental variables associated with topographic features can alter growth of biofilms of epilithic microphytobenthos. Understanding how microphytobenthos responds to local variations in environmental conditions helps to explain spatial patchiness in some intertidal assemblages. Effects of rockpools on temperatures, rates of water-flow and amounts and types of microphytobenthos were quantified using artificial units of habitat (sandstone slabs providing rockpools, non-rockpools and bare rock). Rockpools were cooler and water-flow was less than in other habitats. Amounts of moisture and microphytobenthos were greater around rockpools than elsewhere. Microphytobenthos was most similar to assemblages of cyanobacteria but did not differ among habitats during warm months (November-March). During cool months (May-August), pigments associated with cyanobacteria were less abundant around rock pools than elsewhere. The converse was true for green algae, which were more abundant around rockpools. Thus, micro-habitats had some predictable influences (water flow). Other variables changed predictably, but not always in expected ways (temperature). Yet other variables were far less predictable and the influence of micro-habitats may also extend beyond the immediate vicinity of the micro-habitat (microphytobenthos). To understand the effects of different topographies on hydrodynamics and the responses by organisms, it is essential that measurements are made at appropriate scales and in relation to the different micro-habitats in which they occur. To improve explanations of observed patterns of distribution and behaviour in environments subject to climatic and anthropogenic change, greater understanding of the influences of micro-habitats is required. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Studies on MPB have been conducted mainly in temperate systems, despite that the majority of tidal flats on Earth are found in the tropical zone (∼55\%). To fill this gap of knowledge and evaluate the contribution of tidal flat MPB in one of the most productive estuaries worldwide, sediment cores were collected from 14 stations along the inner Gulf of Nicoya (Costa Rica) at different tidal heights or sea levels (SL) from October 2013 to April 2014. MPB abundance, using chlorophyll a (Chla) biomass as a proxy, and net primary production (PN) and dark respiration (RD), using O2 microsensors, were measured together with other sediment biogeochemical variables in muddy and sandy sediments. Landsat-8 satellite images were used to map the extension of tidal flats and the abundance of MPB using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy. Chla ranged from 0.45 to 7.45 μg cm−2, with higher concentrations observed closer to the river mouth. There was no significant correlation between Chla and SL nor with any other sediment physicochemical variable. MPB abundance estimated by remote sensing displayed considerable spatial heterogeneity, both within and among tidal flats, and clear seasonal differences with higher abundance during the rainy season. PN ranged between 0.8 and 8.6 mmol O2 m−2 h−1, being positively correlated to SL and to the accumulated rain during 30 days prior to the sampling date and inversely to the mean irradiance at noon during the previous month. Daily net community metabolism estimated from PN and RD data and converted to carbon fixation rates indicates that the unvegetated tidal flats of the gulf contribute as much as the total input of allochthonous C from the Tempisque River. However, the results presented here have to be confirmed with direct measurements of C transfer, including the contribution of the adjacent mangrove system. Such studies are crucial to assess the local, regional and global importance of production and other ecosystem services by MPB in tropical areas. © 2024 The Authors},

This dynamic approach aimed at exploring the unique and complex nature of O. cf. ovata bloom development in the benthic system. Epibenthic assemblages were used as inocula for co-cultures of bloom organisms on polycarbonate slides at controlled environmental conditions. Biofilm surface adhesion, growth, and spatial structure were evaluated along with shifts in composition and matrix production in a low disturbance regime, simulating source habitat. Initial adhesion and substratum colonisation appeared as stochastic processes, then community structure and physiognomy markedly changed with time. Dominance of filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms, and dense clusters of Amphidinium cf. carterae at the mature biofilm phases, were recorded by light and confocal microscopy, whilst O. cf. ovata growth was visibly limited in the late culture phases. Life-form strategies, competitiveness for resources, and possibly allelopathic interactions shaped biofilm structure during culture growth. HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis of exopolysaccharidic matrix revealed variations in sugar total amounts and composition. No toxic compounds were detected in the final communities tested by LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) and MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time OF Flight Mass Spectroscopy) techniques. © 2017 by the authors.

	abstract = {Eutrophication in coastal areas has stimulated phytoplankton growth, sustaining a high biomass and leading to a shift in the underwater light field. With the significance of the microphytobenthos for oxygen supply and carbon budget of both benthic and pelagic habitats in mind, the possible effects of reduced light availability were investigated in the estuarine Bodden area (southern Baltic Sea) at 2 sites differing in trophic status - the eutrophic Kirr Bucht (KB) and the mesotrophic Rassower Strom (RS). Using for the first time microsensors in Bodden sediments, it was possible to visualize small-scale heterogeneity in the light regime, photosynthetic activity and oxygen penetration with high spatial and temporal resolution. Hence, differences at the 2 sites related to sediment characteristics (KB sandy, RS muddy), and photoautotrophic biomass (benthic chlorophyll a in the upper 1 cm, μg cm -3 = 11 to 48 at KB and 13 to 17 at RS) could be ruled out. Calculations of benthic primary production based solely on microelectrode measurements revealed substantial oxygen fluxes and carbon fixation rates at in situ light intensities at both study sites (e.g. gross primary production, GPP, mg C m-2 h-1 = 28 to 80 at KB and 3 to 36 at RS). The different combinations of water transparency (pelagic chlorophyll a, μg l-1 = 12 to 33 at KB and 1.3 to 4.5 at RS), light attenuation k (3.17 m-1 at KB, 0.61 m-1 at RS) and water depth (0.6 m at KB, 3.4 m at RA) have led to a similar light availability for benthic algae on the sediment surface at both study sites. Consequently, the benthic algae had comparable productivity at both sites, with maximum primary production, P Bmax (mg C mg-1 chlorophyll a h-1) of 0.29 to 1.46 at KB and 0.17 to 1.63 at RS; and were adapted to rather low light conditions, with light saturation, Ek (μE m-2 s-1) of 22 to 152 at KB and 10 to 116 at RS). Varying with season, microphytobenthic photosynthetic activity accounted for 26 to 59 and 2 to 53 \% to the total primary production at the KB and RS, respectively, with the highest contribution in spring coincident with the most favourable light conditions at the sediment surface. With an annual average of about 37 and 30\% (KB and RS, respectively), the contribution of the microphytobenthos to total production was significant and comparable at both study sites. Nevertheless, the higher trophic status at KB resulted in a change in the benthic microalgal community towards sedimentated phytoplankton species and had a negative impact on microphytobenthic primary production rates. This was estimated by calculating the gross primary production for varying water depths on the basis of the different water transparency at the 2 sites. © Inter-Research 2005.},

Both herbivores enhanced diversity at intermediate grazing pressures, the enhancing effect being stronger with Littorina. This difference is explained by differences in the spatial heterogeneity of the grazed microalgal biofilm caused by behavioural differences in spatial grazing patterns. Idothea spreads its grazing pressure rather evenly in space ('lawn-mower' type), whereas Littorina creates pronounced spatial heterogeneity by moving slowly over the biofilm and decimating it within the grazing tracks ('bulldozer' type). Idothea grazing did not enhance biomass patchiness beyond the level of ungrazed controls (maximum/minimum from 1.7 to 5.5), whereas Littorina strongly increased patchiness (maximum/minimum from 45 to 850).},

However, the link between both ecosystem components (microphytobenthos and faunal communities) is not fully established yet. In this study, spatial patterns and drivers of nematode density and genus composition were investigated at two different spatial scales (i.e. meso- and microscale), with drivers including sediment granulometry, inundation period and food availability as indicated by various phytopigments. Our study has shown that specific food sources, as represented by different pigments and measures of freshness, are important drivers of nematode genus composition and densities at both scales, especially for the surface layers of the sediments. These food sources mainly comprise microphytobenthos, but also deposited phytodetritus and zooplankton faecal pellets, a resource which had hitherto been largely overlooked in intertidal flats. Tidal level and grain size also had a more pronounced structuring effect in the surface layer of the sediment, while their assumed larger importance at the mesoscale was not outspoken. At both scales, vertical heterogeneity in nematode assemblages was larger than horizontal variability, which has repercussions for future studies into the spatial variability of nematode assemblages of tidal flats. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {We investigated the foraging behavior of the mud snail, Ilyanassa obsoleta, and its consequences for macrobenthic community structure on mud flats on Long Island, NY, USA. Field sampling demonstrated strong spatial heterogeneity in the population densities of I. obsoleta. We experimentally tested three hypotheses: (i) I. obsoleta are strongly attracted to areas with high levels of detritus; (ii) local abundances of deposit-feeding annelids are limited by detritus; and (iii) the foraging activities of I. obsoleta negatively affects annelid assemblages. We manipulated the density of mud snails using inclusion fences and the levels of detritus using dried Ulva. Results showed that high densities of I. obsoleta were attracted to areas enriched with Ulva detritus. In addition, high densities of snails negatively affected abundances of annelids, with the opportunistic species, Capitella spp. and Paranais litoralis, being most affected. The addition of Ulva detritus had more specific effects on annelid assemblages. Only Capitella spp. showed a significant positive response, although previous evidence has demonstrated that higher experimental detrital inputs stimulated growth of other species of annelids and microphytobenthos. In an experimental treatment with enhanced detritus and low densities of snails, we found population abundances of opportunistic annelids (up to 200,000 m-2) substantially larger than has ever been recorded in 5 years of sampling. Because mud snails in natural areas actively search, locate and exploit areas with enhanced detritus and their foraging negatively affects abundances of opportunistic worms, I. obsoleta probably controls the upper limits of annelid abundance in the field. Foraging behavior of I. obsoleta therefore modulates spatial variation in benthic community structure in an environment where limiting resources are patchily distributed. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

With the contemporary increase in computational power, model resolution and technological improvements in quality and quantity of benthic data, it is necessary to ensure that benthic systems are appropriately represented in coupled benthic-pelagic biogeochemical and ecological modelling studies. In this paper we focus on five topical challenges related to various aspects of modelling benthic environments: organic matter reactivity, dynamics of benthic-pelagic boundary layer, microphytobenthos, biological transport and small-scale heterogeneity, and impacts of episodic events. We discuss current gaps in their understanding and indicate plausible ways ahead. Further, we propose a three-pronged approach for the advancement of benthic and benthic-pelagic modelling, essential for improved understanding, management and prediction of the marine environment. This includes: (A) development of a traceable and hierarchical framework for benthic-pelagic models, which will facilitate integration among models, reduce risk of bias, and clarify model limitations; (B) extended cross-disciplinary approach to promote effective collaboration between modelling and empirical scientists of various backgrounds and better involvement of stakeholders and end-users; (C) a common vocabulary for terminology used in benthic modelling, to promote model development and integration, and also to enhance mutual understanding. © 2018 Lessin, Artioli, Almroth-Rosell, Blackford, Dale, Glud, Middelburg, Pastres, Queirós, Rabouille, Regnier, Soetaert, Solidoro, Stephens and Yakushev.},

Empirical approaches that have included the influence of heterogeneity tend to be biased towards terrestrial habitats; yet marine systems offer opportunities by virtue of their relative ease of manipulation, rapid response times and the well-understood effects of macrofauna on sediment processes. Here, the influence of heterogeneity on microphytobenthic production in synthetic estuarine assemblages is examined. Heterogeneity was created by enriching patches of sediment with detrital algae (Enteromorpha intestinalis) to provide a source of allochthonous organic matter. A gradient of species density for four numerically dominant intertidal macrofauna (Hediste diversicolor, Hydrobia ulvae, Corophium volutator, Macoma balthica) was constructed, and microphytobenthic biomass at the sediment surface was measured. Statistical analysis using generalized least squares regression indicated that heterogeneity within our system was a significant driving factor that interacted with macrofaunal density and species identity. Microphytobenthic biomass was highest in enriched patches, suggesting that nutrients were obtained locally from the sediment-water interface and not from the water column. Our findings demonstrate that organic enrichment can cause the development of heterogeneity which influences infaunal bioturbation and consequent nutrient generation, a driver of microphytobenthic production. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {We studied the spatial distribution of intertidal macrozoobenthos, microphytobenthos (diatom algae) and sediments at scales from decimeters to kilometers using an index of spatial homogeneity, D(I). Sediments were found to be randomly distributed, making up a mosaic of silty and sandy sites. On the contrary, the estimated spatial variability of macrofauna within all the scales up to 5500 m depended upon neither extent (total area covered) nor grain (finest spatial resolution) but only their ratio. We treat this as evidence of statistical self-similarity (fractal property) of the pattern. For diatoms, spatial heterogeneity of community structure was also self-similar in the range from 0.25 to 75 m (within a single bight). At larger scales, microalgae showed a combination of patchy structure with pronounced gradient along the shoreline from brackish-water to marine flora. Thus, fractal properties of both groups became manifested at scales corresponding to their mean body size. The ranges of fractal patterns were approximately equal to 103-105 if measured in body size units. We suggest that fractal-like spatial structures may be a general feature of communities, and speculate on the nature of such patterns.},

	abstract = {Sabellaria alveolata is a sedentary gregarious tube-building species widely distributed from southwest Scotland to Morocco. This species builds what are currently considered the largest European biogenic reefs in the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (France). As an ecosystem engineer, S. alveolata generates small to large scale topographic complexity, creating numerous spatial and trophic niches for other species to colonize. Sabellaria reefs are also under anthropogenic pressures, leading locally to massive degradation. However, stakeholders lack spatially explicit measures of reef ecological status, at adapted spatial resolution to provide key management information for this protected habitat. Traditional field surveys are extremely time-consuming and rely on expertise for visual ecological status assessment. The present study aims at using an automatic processing approach based on optical airborne data to (i) assess the potential of hyperspectral imagery to discriminate Sabellaria bioconstructions and its main ecosystem associated habitats, including different types of substrate as well as biological components and (ii) to use the combination of the hyperspectral and LiDAR signals to estimate the spatial structure of the different bioconstruction types (veneers vs. hummocks and platforms) and ecological phases (retrograding and prograding). A reef from Mont-Saint-Michel was used as a test site. We built a processing chain based on supervised classification using the Mahalanobis distance to generate an accurate distribution map (overall accuracy of 88\% and a Kappa of 0.85) of 10 Sabellaria-related benthic features, including large reef developing on sand and smaller veneers encrusting rocky shore areas. Specific spectral indices were used to define the spatial distribution of the main primary producers, in particular the microphytobenthos. Joining the hyperspectral and LiDAR data led characterizing the distribution of S. alvealata’s ecological status (prograding and retrograding phases) with an overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient that can respectively amount to up to 93 and 0.86. In our study site, the Sabellaria reef area (between 5.52 and 6.76 ha) was dominated by retrograding phases (between 53 and 58\%). Our results showed that this automatic processing chain could be relevant for the spatial characterization of other Sabellaria reef sites. Study perspectives tend toward a quantitative estimation of their ecological status index. © Copyright © 2020 Bajjouk, Jauzein, Drumetz, Dalla Mura, Duval and Dubois.},

During their intense bioturbation process, they manipulate large amounts of sediment, altering the physical state of existing materials. We investigated whether different types of sediment bioturbation produced by fiddler crabs modulate meiofaunal assemblages and microphytobenthic content. We hypothesized that sedimentary structures produced by burrowing (the burrow itself and the excavation pellets) and feeding (feeding pellets) generate different microenvironments compared with areas without apparent signs of fiddler crab disturbance, affecting both meiofauna and microphytobenthos, independent of the sampling period. Our results indicate that the engineering effects of burrow construction and maintenance and the engineering effects of fiddler crab foraging modulate meiofaunal assemblages in different ways. Overall, meiofauna from burrows and excavation pellets was more abundant and diverse than at control sites, whereas feeding pellets contained poor meiofaunal assemblages. By contrast, only foraging effects were detected on microphytobenthos; independent of the sampling period, Chl a and phaeopigment content were higher in the feeding pellets, but similar among burrows, excavation pellets and control sites. The present study demonstrates that the different engineering effects of fiddler crabs are an important source of habitat heterogeneity and a structuring agent of meiofaunal assemblages on subtropical tidal flats. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia},

Harpacticoids perform periodic and nondirectional migrations; the local intensity of these migrations is trophic-dependent, related to the ratio of real to maximum food consumption rates. The zero-dimensional (non-spatial) analog of the model has three nontrivial equilibrium states, two of which are stable: one corresponds to overgrazing (permanently low abundance of prey controlled by hungry predator); the second is “welfare” (well-fed predator and resource-limited prey). Simulations show that in the spatially distributed model with close-to-real parameter values, two regimes can be realized: either total overgrazing or a persistent heterogeneous dynamic regime with short-lived patches of both populations, similar to that observed in nature. The predator’s ability to migrate narrows the “welfare” domain in parametric space, but increases the trophic efficiency of the system: in this domain, both average prey abundance and average consumption rate for the predator are higher than without migrations. The migrating gain is larger in an environment that is spatially heterogeneous for prey. Assumption of local awareness of the predator (preferred migrations toward a high abundance of prey) has no significant effect on the state of the system. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

	abstract = {Meiobenthos (harpacticoids), microzoobenthos (ciliates) and microphytobenthos (epipelic diatoms and dinoflagellates) were collected during July 1999 using nested sampling at the scales of decimeters, meters and tens of meters. Similarity between samples decreased rapidly with distance for all groups, but unicellular organisms were distributed more heterogeneously at a large scale than meiobenthos. Microspatial (decimeter scale) variations contributed the main part of total variation of harpacticoid abundance, while the large-scale differences were less important. On the contrary, these differences yielded the main variability for ciliates and especially for microalgae. The relative role of temporal variability decreased steadily for the smaller-sized organisms. Stability of spatial structure at multiple scales was estimated by Mantel correlations, Rm, between the successive similarity matrices. For harpacticoids, the results showed intensive and chaotic turnover of microaggregations. For microbenthos, rather high Rm values were found in smaller scales: tens of meters - for ciliates, from meters on - for dinoflagellates, and already from decimeter scale and on - for diatoms. Thus, the general spatial pattern (that is the arrangement of micropatches) was more stable for microbenthos than for meiobenthos. Temporal variability of species structure, in contrast to the spatial one, was highest for the smallest organisms. Correlations between size groups, using both total abundance and species composition, differed for microspatial, meso-spatial or temporal distribution. At the microscale, there were slight but significant negative correlations between harpacticoids and microalgae. Meso-scale distribution of dinoflagellates and diatoms differed significantly due to their different preferences in sediment properties. Ciliates were strongly positively correlated with dinoflagellates. At the microscale, each group had an individual community pattern. At larger scales, species composition of diatoms, ciliates and harpacticoids varied in space in coordination, while dinoflagellates behaved independently. It is hypothesized that body size determines the spatio-temporal scale of the perception of environmental heterogeneity. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sediment erosion results from hydrodynamic forcing, represented by the bottom shear stress (BSS), and from the erodability of the sediment, defined by the critical erosion shear stress and the erosion rate. Abundant literature has dealt with the effects of biological components on sediment erodability and concluded that sediment processes are highly sensitive to the biota. However, very few sediment transport models account for these effects. We provide some background on the computation of BSS, and on the classical erosion laws for fine sand and mud, followed by a brief review of biota effects with the aim of quantifying the latter into generic formulations, where applicable. The effects of macrophytes, microphytobenthos, and macrofauna are considered in succession. Marine vegetation enhances the bottom dissipation of current energy, but also reduces shear stress at the sediment-water interface, which can be significant when the shoot density is high. The microphytobenthos and secreted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) stabilise the sediment, and an increase of up to a factor of 5 can be assigned to the erosion threshold on muddy beds. However, the consequences with respect to the erosion rate are debatable since, once the protective biofilm is eroded, the underlying sediment probably has the same erosion behaviour as bare sediment. In addition, the development of benthic diatoms tends to be seasonal, so that stabilising effects are likely to be minimal in winter. Macrofaunal effects are characterised by extreme variability. For muddy sediments, destabilisation seems to be the general trend; this can become critical when benthic communities settle on consolidated sediments that would not be eroded if they remained bare. Biodeposition and bioresuspension fluxes are mentioned, for comparison with hydrodynamically induced erosion rates. Unlike the microphytobenthos, epifaunal benthic organisms create local roughness and are likely to change the BSS generated by the flow. In this paper, we attempt to describe state-of-the-art sediment transport models accounting for biological processes. Such applications generally demonstrate a clear effect of the biota on erosion/deposition, but morphodynamic coupling is rarely achieved. In the present study, a modelling exercise of this type was run, based on a cross-shore morphodynamic model of an intertidal mudflat [Waeles, B., Le Hir, P., Silva Jacinto, R., 2004. Modélisation morphodynamique cross-shore d'un estran vaseux. Comptes Rendus Geoscience 336, 1025-1033] in which the equilibrium profile of the intertidal flat under tide and wave forcing is simulated. A seasonal presence of the microphytobenthos in late spring and summer, represented by a fourfold increase in the erosion threshold, generates sediment level changes of about 5 cm. However, these effects disappear in autumn and winter when the erosion threshold returns to its abiotic value, even when wave erosion is ignored. In contrast, the reduction of BSS in the upper flat to simulate the effect of a saltmarsh induces a spectacular seaward shift of the upper flat. The simulations show the strong, potential, long-term effect of vegetated beds, i.e. the protection of sediment from wave erosion. In contrast, local stabilisation by the microphytobenthos does not have a significant long-term effect. Some recommendations are given on the need to define experimental protocols for erosion tests and studies on biota effects. A stochastic approach is suggested to cope with the problem of patchiness and extreme variability of erodability patterns, combined with histograms of BSS. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The medium to long-term recovery of benthic microproducers in restored habitats designed to improve degraded coastal wetland sites is largely unknown. Using taxon-specific photopigments, we describe the composition of microphytobenthic communities in a large restoration site in southern California and differences in the temporal recovery of biomass (chlorophyll a), composition, and taxonomic diversity between vegetated Spartina foliosa salt marsh and unvegetated mudflat. Visually distinct, spatially discreet, microphytobenthic patches appeared after no more than 7 mo within the restoration site and were distinguished by significant differences in biomass, taxonomic diversity, and the relative abundance of cyanobacteria versus diatoms. Sediment chlorophyll a concentrations within the restored site were similar to concentrations in nearby natural habitat 0.2-2.2 yr following marsh creation, suggesting rapid colonization by microproducers. Restored Spartina marsh very rapidly (between 0.2 and 1.2 yr) acquired microphytobenthic communities of similar composition and diversity to those in natural Spartina habitat, but restored mudflats took at least 1.6 to 2.2 yr to resemble natural mudflats. These results suggest relatively rapid recovery of microphytobenthic communities at the level of major taxonomic groups. Sediment features, such as pore water salinity and Spartina density, explained little variation in microphytobenthic taxonomic composition. The data imply that provision of structural heterogeneity in wetland construction (such as pools and vascular plants) might speed development of microproducer communities, but no direct seeding of sediment microfloras may be necessary. © 2007 Estuarine Research Federation.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the interactions between sediment stability and biological and physical variables that influence the erodibility across different habitats. Sampling at short-term temporal scales illustrated the persistence of the microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass even during periods of frequent, high physical disturbance. The role of MPB in biological stabilization along the changing sedimentary habitat was also assessed. Key biological and physical properties, such as the MPB biomass, composition, and extracellular polymeric substances, were used to predict the sediment stability (erosion threshold) of muddy and sandy habitats within close proximity to one another over multiple days, and within emersion periods. The effects of dewatering, MPB growth, and productivity were examined as well as the resilience and recovery of the MPB community after disturbance from tidal currents and waves. Canonical analysis of principal components (CAP) ordinations were used to visualize and assess the trends observed in biophysical properties between the sites, and marginal and sequential distance-based linear models were used to identify the key properties influencing erodibility. While the particle size of the bed was important for differences between sites in the CAP analysis, it contributed less to the variability in sediment erodibility than key biological parameters. Among the biological predictors, MPB diversity explained very little variation in marginal tests but was a significant predictor in sequential tests when MPB biomass was also considered. MPB diversity and biomass were both key predictors of sediment stability, contributing 9\% and 10\%, respectively, to the final model compared to 2\% explained by grain size. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {The density, spatial structure and functional roles of macrofaunal and microphytobenthic (MPB) communities change across sedimentary gradients. Grazing by macrofauna can impose considerable top-down control on MPB biomass at the scale of the animal’s feeding ambit (cm scale), yet how relationships between deposit feeders and MPB scale up across such transitional environments (10’s m scale) is poorly understood. We determined the relationship between sediment chlorophyll-a concentration (a proxy of MPB biomass), distance to feeding traces (a proxy of recent deposit feeding activity) made by the tellinid bivalve Macomona liliana (at cm scale) and macrofaunal densities (at 10’s m scale) across a sediment mud content gradient. Correlative relationships, estimated by generalised least-squares regression, between recent deposit feeding activity and MPB biomass were scale dependent and significant only at the site (10’s m) scale. MPB biomass declined by 28 \% as coverage of feeding traces increased from 2 to 28 \%, with feeding trace area contributing significantly to variation in chlorophyll-a (std. coefficient = −0.24, p = 0.01). However, the interaction term between the density of the suspension-feeding clam Austrovenus stutchburyi and sediment mud content explained a larger amount of the variability (std. coefficient = 0.72, p {\textless} 0.001). Our results demonstrate that significant effects on MPB biomass can emerge across large, spatially heterogeneous areas of tidal flat, despite appearing stochastic at small scales. They also highlight the need to consider interactions between MPB and macrofauna across abiotic gradients and the potential roles of non-deposit feeding taxa. © 2014, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

	abstract = {Temperature is an important factor for fish. Yet, little is known about temperature effects on the feeding behavior of fish and the subsequent consequences of these behavioral changes on the spatial distribution of resources. We analyzed the differences in the feeding behavior of two size classes of juvenile Liza aurata at two water temperatures (i.e. 10. °C and 20. °C), using laboratory mesocosms. We also examined whether potential temperature-induced changes in feeding behavior of the smaller size of L. aurata would affect the spatial distribution of the microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass, an important resource in coastal systems. Both the number of feeding events and the swimming velocity during feeding were higher at 20. °C than at 10. °C, independent of the fish size. The time spent feeding did not vary between 10. °C and 20. °C, while the distance covered during feeding was significantly smaller at 20. °C than at 10. °C. Grazing did not affect the mean MPB biomass, but did increase its spatial variance at the smaller scale (i.e. a few centimeters) at 20. °C. A high number of feeding events, a high swimming velocity during feeding and a small distance covered during feeding in 20. °C-acclimated L. aurata most likely represented an adaptation to an increase in metabolism, as well as to the need to reduce the energy costs of feeding at 20. °C. Results also indicated that changes in feeding behavior of the 20. °C-acclimated L. aurata were responsible for the increase in small-scale spatial variability in the MPB biomass but not an overall significant effect on the MPB mean. We suggested that the enhanced spatial patchiness due to grazing by fish at 20. °C might yield a local increase in the mean MPB biomass, probably increasing photosynthetic efficiency of cells and algal growth that counterbalance the negative effect of algal removal by fish. © 2013.},

	abstract = {Marine sediment may contain both settled phytoplankton and benthic microalgae (BMA). In river-dominated, shallow continental shelf systems, spatial, and temporal heterogeneity in sediment type and water-column characteristics (e.g., turbidity and primary productivity) may promote spatial variation in the relative contribution of these two sources to the sediment organic matter pool available to benthic consumers. Here we use photosynthetic pigment analysis and microscopic examination of sediment microalgae to investigate how the biomass, composition, and degradation state of sediment-associated microalgae vary along the Louisiana (USA) inner shelf, a region strongly influenced by the Mississippi River. Three sandy shoals and surrounding muddy sediments with depths ranging from 4 to 20 m were sampled in April, August, and October 2007. Pigment composition suggested that sediment microalgae were primarily diatoms at all locations. We found no significant differences in sediment chlorophyll a concentrations (8-77 mg m-2) at the shoal and off-shoal stations. Epipelic pennate diatoms (considered indicative of BMA) made up a significantly greater proportion of sediment diatoms at sandy (50-98\%) compared to more silty off-shoal stations (16-56\%). The percentage of centric diatoms (indicators of settled phytoplankton) in the sediment was highest in August. Sediment total pheopigment concentrations on sandy stations ({\textless}20 mg m-2) were significantly lower than concentrations at nearby muddy stations ({\textgreater}40 mg m-2), suggesting differences in sediment microalgal degradation state. These observations suggest that BMA predominate in shallow sandy sediments and that phytodetritus predominates at muddy stations. Our results also suggest that the relative proportion of phytodetritus in the benthos was highest where phytoplankton biomass in the overlying water was greatest, independent of sediment type. The high biomass of BMA found on shoals suggests that benthic primary production on sandy sediments represents a potentially significant local source of sediment microalgal carbon that may be utilized by benthic consumers in continental shelf food webs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Microphytobenthos biomass did not differ significantly among the lagoons, but showed higher values in the summer. The macrofauna was characterized by low species richness and the dominance of the gastropod Heleobia australis, the tanaidean Kalliapseudes schubartti and the bivalve Erodona mactroides. The meiofauna was composed of 20 higher taxa and the nematodes dominated in all the lagoons and periods. Desmodora (Desmodora) sp.1, Terschllingia sp. and Microlaimus sp. were numerically the most important among the 74 nematode species registered. This study showed that, in the Laguna Estuarine System, differences in the benthos among lagoons and periods were dependent on the fauna component analyzed. Whilst macrofauna and nematodes were significantly more diverse in the inner stations, in the Mirim Lagoon, the number of meiofauna taxa did not differ significantly among the lagoons and the diversity and evenness were highest in Santo Antonio. These results were a response of the fauna to the salinity oscillations coupled with the heterogeneity of the sediment in the lagoons. The temporal variability of the fauna, macrofauna being more abundant in the summer and meiofauna in the winter, could be related to the different life strategies of these groups. © 2006, UNIV SAOPAULO.

	abstract = {The current decrease in biodiversity affects all ecosystems, and the impacts of diversity on ecosystem functioning need to be resolved. So far, marine studies about diversity–ecosystem productivity-relationships have concentrated on small-scale, controlled experiments, with often limited relevance to natural ecosystems. Here, we provide a real-world study on the effects of microorganismal diversity (measured as the diversity of benthic diatom communities) on ecosystem productivity (using chlorophyll a concentration as a surrogate) in a heterogeneous marine coastal archipelago. We collected 78 sediment cores at 17 sites in the northern Baltic Sea and found exceptionally high diatom diversity (328 observed species). We used structural equation models and quantile regression to explore relationships between diatom diversity and productivity. Previous studies have found contradictory results in the relationship between microorganismal diversity and ecosystem productivity, but we showed a linear and positive basal relationship between diatom diversity and productivity, which indicates that diatom diversity most likely forms the lowest boundary for productivity. Thus, although productivity can be high even when diatom diversity is low, high diatom diversity supports high productivity. The trait composition was more effective than taxonomical composition in showing such a relationship, which could be due to niche complementarity. Our results also indicated that environmental heterogeneity leads to substantial patchiness in the diversity of benthic diatom communities, mainly induced by the variation in sediment organic matter content. Therefore, future changes in precipitation and river runoff and associated changes in the quality and quantity of organic matter in the sea, will also affect diatom communities and, hence, ecosystem productivity. Our study suggests that benthic microorganisms are vital for ecosystem productivity, and together with the substantial heterogeneity of coastal ecosystems, they should be considered when evaluating the potential productivity of coastal areas. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America},

	abstract = {Significant spatial variation in species composition of microphytobenthos often occurs at scales of decimetres. This microscale variation is typically more connected with dispersal-related events than to environmental factors. In this study, 4 microscale transects were delimited at 4 temperate lowland peat bog localities to investigate spatial and temporal microscale variations in benthic desmids (Desmidiales, Viridiplantae). Significant spatial autocorrelation was detected in most of the transects taken 3 times, in September and December 2010 and March 2011. The relative abundance of species data produced more pronounced spatial patterns than the presence-absence data. Spatial autocorrelation mostly decreased during the winter period, possibly due to meteorological disturbances, resulting in less spatially structured phytobenthic community in the March transects. In most cases, spatial distance accounted for a significant part of the variation in a community structure, even in analyses that controlled for the effects of environmental and temporal factors. This indicated that pure spatial factors should be considered important for structuring phytobenthic communities, even across a temporal time span of 6 months. The reduced data sets that included only 25 \% of the most frequented species produced very similar patterns in spatial and temporal autocorrelation as the full data sets. Consequently, we concluded that microscale variation of benthic desmids may be sufficiently represented by dynamics of the common species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Despite its importance, temporal turnover of benthic communities has been studied to a lesser extent than spatial heterogeneity has. In this study, we examine the desmid assemblages on small spatial scale in relation to the spatial, temporal, and environmental parameters. The samples were collected within two different types of peatland localities in the Czech Republic over 3 years. The differences in species composition between samples were mainly correlated with the geographic distance, while the effects of the environmental and temporal variables were much weaker. Since the spatial heterogeneity of the assemblages was not induced by the variation of the environmental factors or by the restricted dispersal ability at such a small spatial scale, we assume that both the temporal stability and strong spatial autocorrelation might have been the result of a priority effect, with subsequent monopolization of resources. Stochasticity in colonization can introduce noise into the match between community composition and environmental conditions, which may result in stronger effect of the spatial parameters on the community structure. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Within days to weeks after the addition of a lugworm to a homogenized and recomposed sediment, the average surficial MPB biomass and its spatial heterogeneity were, respectively, 150-250\% and 280\% higher than in sediments without lugworms. The surficial sediment area impacted by a single medium-sized lugworm (∼4 g wet weight) over this time-scale was at least 340 cm2. While sediment reworking was the primary cause of the increased spatial heterogeneity, experiments with lugworm-mimics together with modeling showed that bioadvective porewater transport from depth to the sediment surface, as induced by the lugworm ventilating its burrow, was the main cause of the increased surficial MPB biomass. Although direct measurements of nutrient fluxes are lacking, our present data show that enhanced advective supply of nutrients from deeper sediment layers induced by faunal ventilation is an important mechanism that fuels high primary productivity at the surface of permeable sediments even though these systems are generally characterized by low standing stocks of nutrients and organic material. © 2015 Chennu et al.

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a three-step procedure to infer the spatial heterogeneity in microphytobenthos primary productivity at the scale of tidal estuaries and embayments. The first step involves local measurement of the carbon assimilation rate of benthic microalgae to determine the parameters of the photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) curves (using non-linear optimization methods). In the next step, a resampling technique is used to rebuild pseudo-sampling distributions of the local productivity estimates; these provide error estimates for determining the significance level of differences between sites. The third step combines the previous results with deterministic models of tidal elevation and solar irradiance to compute mean and variance of the daily areal primary productivity over an entire intertidal mudflat area within each embayment. This scheme was applied on three different intertidal mudflat regions of the San Francisco Bay estuary during autumn 1998. Microphytobenthos productivity exhibits strong (ca. 3-fold) significant differences among the major sub-basins of San Francisco Bay. This spatial heterogeneity is attributed to two main causes: significant differences in the photosynthetic competence (P-E parameters) of the microphytobenthos in the different sub-basins, and spatial differences in the phase shifts between the tidal and solar cycles controlling the exposure of intertidal areas to sunlight. The procedure is general and can be used in other estuaries to assess the magnitude and patterns of spatial variability of microphytobenthos productivity at the level of the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Rates of primary production by intertidal microphytobenthos within biofilms have been shown to be very high. An essential step toward assessing the contribution of individual species to this level of production is the in vivo measurement of photosynthetic efficiency from individual cells. A strong relationship between photosystem II photochemical efficiency and the fluorescence parameter F(q)'/F(m)' (where F(q)' = F(m)' - F') has been established within higher plants and unicellular algae. Calculation of F(q)'/F(m)' requires measurement under constant light (at the F' level of fluorescence) and during a pulse of saturating light (at the F(m)' level of fluorescence). High-resolution imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence at the F' and F(m)' levels has allowed the construction of F(q)'/F(m)' images from individual cells of several species of diatom and Euglena sp. within intact biofilms. No species differences in the values of F(q)'/F(m)' were observed at low levels of incident light. However, Euglena sp. showed significantly higher F(q)'/F(m)' values at moderate to high incident light levels than all of the diatom species. Endogenous rhythms of vertical migration during tidal exposure and peaks in photosystem II photochemical efficiency at low tide could also be followed using this technique. Clear differences were observed in the migration of individual taxa to the surface of the biofilm. Images of F(q)'/F(m)' were also used to assess the scale of heterogeneity for this parameter. Overall, these data demonstrate that high-resolution imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence is a valuable technique that allows for determination of the photosystem II photochemical efficiency from different microphytobenthic taxa within biofilms.},

	abstract = {Trophodynamics of intertidal mudflats are significantly driven by microphytobenthos (MPB) production but spatial and temporal dynamics of this production source is poorly known. To understand the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of intertidal MPB, benthic chlorophyll a, phaeopigments, and sediment properties were determined in Gyehwa (sandy) and Gwanghwal (muddy) tidal flats of Saemangeum area over a year at 97 stations. This study set out to: (i) characterize the spatial-temporal patterns in MPB biomass on a year-round basis, (ii) identify the abiotic and biotic factors associated with MPB distributions, (iii) investigate the use of satellite-derived chlorophyll a data and verify with in field measurements, and (iv) determine minimum required sample size for in situ biomass measurement. Concentrations of benthic chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were greater in winter and spring with a high magnitude of variance than in summer and fall at both areas. Benthic chlorophyll a and phaeopigments tended to decrease approaching lower tidal zone, being associated with the corresponding decrease in shore level and/or exposure duration. Compared to available data on macrozoobenthos distribution, the spatial variation of microalgal biomass seems to be attributed to distribution of deposit-feeders. A significant positive correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) between in situ MPB biomass and satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values was observed, but was much weaker in the lower tidal zone. Mirroring algal heterogeneity, the minimum required sample size for in situ biomass measurement were greater in blooming season and sandy bottom, suggesting that sampling design for spatio-temporal mapping of MPB should consider the sampling season and/or abiotic and biotic features of study area. Overall, spatio-temporal dynamics of intertidal MPB seem to be influenced by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. © 2016},

In a created marsh in southern California (USA), we tested the individual and combined effects of two epibenthic invertebrates on nutrient and biomass pools, community structure, and physical habitat features. We manipulated snail (Cerithidea californica) and crab (Pachygrapsus crassipes) presence in field enclosures planted with pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at elevations matching the plant's lower extent in an adjacent natural marsh. In the 4-month experiment, C. californica altered habitat structure by reducing sediment surface heterogeneity and shear strength (a measure of sediment stability) markedly throughout the enclosures. Both invertebrates had strong negative effects on a group of correlated sediment physicochemical characteristics, including nitrogen and organic matter concentrations and soil moisture. In addition, both invertebrates greatly reduced benthic chlorophyll a, a proxy for biomass of microphytobenthos. Compared to controls, macroalgal cover was up to sixfold lower with crabs present, while snails increased cover at low elevations of enclosures. Unexpectedly, macroalgal cover was eliminated with both species present, perhaps through P. crassipes consumption of larger thalli and C. californica reduction in cover of recruits. Neither species influenced the S. virginica canopy (quantified with an index of branch length and number); however, at the lower elevation of enclosures, the two species together negatively impacted the plant canopy. The two invertebrates' modifications to our experimental marshes led to distinct suites of biotic and physicochemical features depending on their presence or co-occurrence, with the latter producing several unexpected results. We propose that the roles and interactions of habitat-modifying fauna deserve further attention, particularly in the context of efforts to conserve and restore the processes found in natural systems. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatial structure of microphytobenthos (MPB) on intertidal flats is necessary to gain insight in the benthic community structure and ecosystem processes. The increasing availability of high resolution satellite sensors provides the opportunity to better understand spatial patterns of MPB on various (meter to km) scales. We tested how MPB patch size (indicated by the range derived from a semi-variogram) and degree of patchiness (indicated by the sill) vary as function of seasons, salinity, tidal flat type (muddy fringing versus sandy mid-channel tidal flats) or ecotopes (defined by hydrodynamics, silt content and elevation), in the Westerschelde estuary, the Netherlands. We used Sentinel-2 imagery (2016–2019) with 10 m spatial resolution to derive (omnidirectional) semi-variogram parameters from the NDVI (used as indicator for MPB biomass) and evaluated (seasonality in) patchiness of MPB in the different categories. We demonstrated that MPB patch size (the range) remains constant from winter to summer, while the sill increased from winter to summer. The location of patches on tidal flats was variable throughout the year and shows a remarkable similarity with seasonality in the spatial heterogeneity of the silt content on tidal flats. The patch size and degree of patchiness is higher on relatively sandy mid-channel tidal flats than on relatively silt rich fringing tidal flats. This implies that spatial patterning of MPB biomass on the meso-scale is likely closely linked to abiotic conditions and that spreading processes or grazing activity play a minor role. We observed visually that some areas with a relatively high MPB biomass (‘patches’) remain visible throughout the year, while other patches were only present during a particular season. © Copyright © 2020 Daggers, Herman and van der Wal.},

	abstract = {Seagrass meadows support intense but highly variable benthic metabolic rates that still need to be better evaluated to determine an accurate trophic status. The present study assessed how seagrasses and associated benthic macrofauna control spatiotemporal changes in benthic oxygen exchanges within a temperate bay. Based on seasonal sampling over a complete year cycle, the diffusive oxygen uptake (DOU), community respiration (CR) and gross primary production (GPP) were measured in a Zostera noltei meadow within Arcachon Bay, taking into account its spatial heterogeneity. Oxygen fluxes were assessed in sediment cores, within which benthic macrofauna and seagrass abundances and biomasses were quantified. The presence of Z. noltei did not significantly affect the DOU. Seasonal changes in CR and GPP correlated strongly with temperature in the presence of Z. noltei. The characteristics of benthic macrofauna associated with Z. noltei only weakly affected seasonal changes in CR. High spatial changes in both GPP and CR were mainly driven by the aboveground biomass of Z. noltei. When extrapolated to the whole intertidal area of the bay, in spite of limitations, our results suggest (1) overall higher contributions to CR and GPP from the seagrass meadow than from bare sediments, even though alternative primary producers in bare sediments (likely microphytobenthos) contributed significantly during winter; (2) an annual decrease in CR and GPP of 35 and 41\%, respectively, resulting from the decline in Z. noltei of 25\% between 2005 and 2007; and (3) a strong seasonality in the magnitude of this decrease, which was high during autumn and low during winter. © Inter-Research 2016.},

We compared chlorophyll content and productivity of natural algal communities (phytoplankton, epipelon, epilithon, epixylon, and epiphyton) experiencing high ({\textgreater}10\%) incident radiation in lakes in the US, Greenland, and Quebec, Canada. Chlorophyll content and productivity differed significantly among regions, but they also differed consistently among communities independent of region. Chlorophyll content of periphyton on hard substrata (rocks and wood) was positively related to water-column total P (TP), whereas chlorophyll content of algae on sediment (epipelon) and TP were not significantly related. Chlorophyll content was up to 100× higher on sediments than on hard substrata. Within regions, chlorophyll-specific primary productivity was highest for phytoplankton and lowest for epipelon. Periphyton on hard substrata and on macrophytes (epiphyton) had similar rates of chlorophyll-specific productivity that were intermediate to those of epipelon and phytoplankton. Area-specific productivity of epipelon was 5 to 10× higher than area-specific productivity of periphyton on hard substrata. This broad geographic comparison indicates that, in low to moderately productive lakes under high-light conditions, algal communities have predictable differences in area-specific and chlorophyll-specific productivity based on substratum. As such, chlorophyll alone is an inadequate predictor of the relative contributions of different algal communities to total primary production. Our results highlight the importance of the relative abundance and spatial distributions of substrata in determining the role of the littoral zones in nutrient and energy cycles in lakes. © 2006 by The North American Benthological Society.},

We observed a linear relationship between the minimal fluorescence, F0, and the chlorophyll a content of the sediments, but the relationship was quite noisy, which was partly due to a vertical scale mismatch between the depth of sampling (1 mm) and the measuring depth the of PAM fluorometer (100 to 200 μm). On most sites, C fixation was a linear function of photosystem II electron transport (ETR, obtained from PAM measurements), although for Stn B, a relatively silty site on the Molenplaat, an intertidal flat in the Westerschelde, the agreement between C fixation and ETR was often non-linear at irradiances saturating C fixation. This was sometimes observed for some of the other stations as well. The differences at high irradiance might be related to vertical migration of epipelic diatoms, optical properties of the sediment or alternative electron acceptors. A conversion factor was calculated, allowing estimation of C fixation from ETR measurements. This conversion factor was not different for the different stations and no clear seasonal influence was observed, although the conversion factor could vary within hours. The seasonally averaged conversion factor for all stations and each site was used to calculate areal rates of production and compared with primary production estimates obtained from the C fixation measurements. It appeared that the PAM-based estimates gave a good prediction of the (potential) C fixation, with the exception of a number of dates for Molenplaat Stn B. This demonstrates that the variable fluorescence technique can become, after further calibration with 14C for other shallow sediments, a very useful tool in production studies, and can be instrumental in obtaining a good spatial coverage of primary production, which remains very difficult due to the patchiness in microphytobenthos biomass and production.},

Until now it has not been possible to distinguish between benthic photosynthetic microorganisms, i.e. cyanobacteria and diatoms, at μm to mm scales using a single nondisruptive system. Chlorophyll autofluorescence can be used to distinguish different photoautotrophic groups if the correct excitation light is applied. Using this principle, a nonintrusive technique was developed to study the spatial distribution of benthic cyanobacteria and diatoms. By means of a charge coupled device camera, diatoms and cyanobacteria could be identified by blue light (470 nm) excitation and amber light (600 nm) excitation, respectively. By this approach, diatom or cyanobacterial dominance could be easily distinguished using the blue over amber ratio. We applied this method successfully to (mixed) laboratory cultures as well as natural photosynthetic microbial mats. Cultures of the diatom Nitzschia capitellata and the cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. showed close correlation between autofluorescence and cell abundance. This simple and cheap imaging system allows fast observations of the fine-scale (μm–mm) spatial heterogeneities of live benthic microbial photoautotrophs both in culture and natural photosynthetic biofilms structure (e.g., microphytobenthos and photosynthetic microbial mats). © 2015 and 2014 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.},

	abstract = {In shallow coastal areas the amplitude and range of benthic silicic acid fluxes can have a significant influence on benthic-pelagic coupling and the functioning of the pelagic system. To explore the oscillation in fluxes over the diurnal cycle and in particular the influence of microphytobenthos (MPB), an experiment was carried out in a shallow subtidal site in the Bay of Brest (France). Benthic chambers were employed over a 48 h period to measure the variability in silicic acid and oxygen fluxes; MPB migration was investigated using a diving Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometer and uptake rhythms of silicic acid by natural MPB populations were measured using the 32Si isotope. It was discovered that silicic acid fluxes fluctuated greatly throughout the diurnal period resulting in an oscillation in the availability of this nutrient for phytoplankton communities. The uptake of silicic acid by the MPB was quantified for the first time and highlighted a 2-fold increase in the demand from night to afternoon periods. The combined silicic acid uptake and the concentration of cells at the sediment-water interface, forming a dense biofilm of MPB, were postulated to be the main processes reducing effluxes at midday. Our work highlighted the many processes which influence silicic acid effluxes in shallow coastal areas and the possible interaction between uptake and dissolution processes. The variations in benthic fluxes over the diurnal period were comparable to observations reported at the seasonal scale. Therefore, up-scaling hourly flux observations to daily and annual estimates should be undertaken with caution. Further we suggest that the main processes influencing flux oscillations over the diurnal period should be considered when planning sampling strategies and extrapolating to larger time scales. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB), typically comprised mainly of diatoms, is a key contributor to nearshore energy flow and nutrient cycles. Deposit-feeding invertebrates are known to alter the structure and activity of MPB. The eastern mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta can reach extremely high densities in estuaries of the northwestern Atlantic, and their deposit-feeding and locomotion strongly influence other invertebrates and microbes. Our objective was to explore quantitative and qualitative effects of this keystone deposit-feeder on diatoms of intertidal sediments. We gathered snails from mudflat and sandflat habitats and collected their fresh fecal pellets in the laboratory. DNA metabarcoding allowed us to characterize diatom assemblages of ingested sediments and feces. We noted selective feeding such that reduction in MPB biomass with gut passage was difficult to quantify. Diatom α-diversity was reduced with gut passage in snails from both sedimentary regimes. Mudflat and sandflat diatom assemblages were distinct and differed markedly between feces and sediment in mud-feeding snails, whereas the difference in sand-feeding snails was minor. The sandy habitat was dominated by a mix of epipelic and epipsammic diatoms. In contrast, mudflat samples were dominated by epipelic and planktonic diatoms. Compositional differences between sediment and feces reflected preferential removal of planktonic taxa. Our results suggest the importance of phytodetritus to the mud snail diet, particularly in hydrodynamically quiescent environments. Due to the natural spatial patchiness of the snails and the capacity for rapid microbial recolonization, field experiments are recommended to determine whether MPB community changes attributed to gut passage are manifested at the landscape scale. © 2023 The Authors.

It addresses X- and L-band SAR signatures over intertidal flats and coastal salt-marshes by investigating the mean backscattering coefficient σ0 over the major environmental units and its variation associated with physical parameters (soil roughness, soil moisture, tidal inundation) and instrumental configurations. The major findings outline a great potential of TerraSAR-X data to detect oyster beds and discriminate Zostera noltii seabed from salt-marsh vegetation species. Based on these results, a multi-sensor multi-temporal mapping strategy was tested running simple supervised classification algorithms. These tests show that mapping performance is greatly enhanced when running Mahalanobis classifier on a 6-band concatenated image.

Erosion shear stress and corresponding bio-geo-chemical parameters of tidal flats were measured over five years in the Sylt/Romo Bight, Germany. Ground-based optical reflectance spectra were measured during one year. A significant dependence of erosion shear stress on the benthic diatom chlorophyll a concentration in the uppermost 1-mm layer was found for muddy areas but decreased with decreasing proportion of fine particles ({\textless} 63 μm). With a low phytobenthic coverage there was a weak dependence of erosion shear stress on the proportion of fine particles. There were two main classes of the reflectance spectra: containing information on sediment type i.e. proportion of fine particles, and containing information on benthic diatoms and other phytobenthic species. There was a significant correlation between the reflectance spectra and proportion of fine particles and also between reflectance spectra and benthic diatom chlorophyll a concentration. Hence, the erodibility of tidal fiats can be mapped by optical remote sensing when benthic chlorophyll a concentration and proportion of fine particles are used for estimation of the erosion shear stress.},

	abstract = {Carbon fixation by microphytobenthic algae of intertidal flats often dominates the total primary production of turbid, temperate estuaries. Whilst remote sensing can accurately measure the spatial distribution of photosynthetic biofilms at the mesoscale (1–300 m), variability at smaller scales requires in-situ investigation. Here, changes in biomass and photosynthetic activity of microphytobenthos (MPB) at the micro-scale ({\textless}1 m) were investigated. Biomass of MPB was estimated from repeated high resolution spectral measurements carried out at intervals along a short transect. Whilst the mean concentration of MPB remained constant over time, considerable variability in the spatial and temporal dimensions was measured. The biofilm grew and diminished along the transect over time, and net growth and loss rates could be established under natural conditions. Daily vertical migration was observed for the first time in an undisturbed sediment, and was modeled as a function of solar elevation and tidal angle. Top down factors such as grazing, or physical disturbance, played an important role in the changes in biomass. Photosynthetic activity was measured with portable fluorometers: one device used an artificial light source, the other measured the effective photosystem-II quantum efficiency (ΔF/Fm′) in-situ with solar irradiance. No evidence was found for photoinhibition, with Fv/Fm values consistently high, indicating an ability of the diatom biofilm to remain productive under periods of high irradiance. The maximum rate of photosynthesis reached with artificial light was rarely achieved in-situ, even with full solar exposure. There was, however, a very good agreement between the predicted rate at ambient irradiance, and that actually measured. Composite photosynthesis-irradiance curves over the whole experimental period were similar, and showed the same initial slopes, but the maximum rate of relative photosynthetic electron transport (rETRm) based on the in-situ measurement was lower. When total depth-averaged primary production during low tide was calculated, the differences between methods varied between 5 and 13\%, and were smallest when surface irradiance values were highest. These results show that the protocol used to measure the photosynthetic activity of the MPB had only minor importance on the overall productivity estimate compared to accurate knowledge of photosynthetically active biomass and irradiance. © Copyright © 2020 Kromkamp, Morris and Forster.},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthic (MPB) biofilms are taxonomically mixed microbial assemblages (e.g. cyanobacteria, chlorophyta and diatoms) responsible for important estuarine ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient fluxes, sediment cohesion, and primary productivity). MPB biofilms exhibit high spatial-temporal variation leading to high variability in collected data and requiring high sampling replication. Thus there is an increasing interest in developing remote sensing tools to quantify and describe MPB biofilms. The objectives of the current work were to investigate the effect of MPB taxonomic diversity on biofilm spectral reflectance signatures and to investigate the possibility of using second derivative analysis to estimate MPB chlorophyll a (as a proxy for biomass) and pigment composition in monospecific and mixed species biofilms. Two diatoms, Amphora coffeaeformis (Agardh) Kützing and Cylindrotheca closterium (Ehrenberg) W. Smith; one green algae, Dunaliella tertiolecta and one cyanobacteria, Spirulina platensis (Gomont) Geitler were used to construct artificial MPB biofilms on glass fiber filters. Biofilms with a range of different MPB concentrations and different taxonomic groups were constructed, their spectral reflectances were measured with a ASD FieldSpec 3FR spectroradiometer and pigments were extracted and measured by HPLC. The best relationships between pigment concentration and second derivative spectra (δδ) obtained with monospecific biofilms were: δδ548 for fucoxanthin, δδ590 for zeaxanthin, δδ650 for chlorophyll b and δδ675 for chlorophyll a. The relationship between δδ590 and zeaxanthin was probably the result of covariation with phycocyanin or phycoeritrin. δδ590 and δδ650 were strongly affected by the presence of other taxonomic groups in the mixed species biofilms and underestimated the respective pigments, while δδ548 and δδ675 could be used to estimate directly fucoxanthin and chlorophyll a in taxonomically mixed biofilms. The relationship between δδ675 and chlorophyll a was strongly affected by the presence of a second derivative double peak caused by chlorophyll fluorescence in the red region and was highly dependent on the smoothing amount applied to the original reflectance spectra. An alternative was proposed using the area of the second derivative peaks between 660 and 690nm (A[δδRED]). This index showed very good relationships with MPB chlorophyll a concentration and was almost insensitive to the amount of smoothing applied to the original spectra. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {China's coastal mudflats, threatened by artificial reclamation and climate change, are undergoing drastic changes and their accurate mapping is important for their conservation and restoration. Traditional classification methods, which require large samples and complex classifiers, tend to have low computational efficiency and poor generalization ability; thus, they are unsuitable for the rapid and accurate extraction of coastal mudflats. This study proposes a Mudflat Index (MFI) based on hyperspectral images. MFI amplifies the difference in spectral characteristics between mudflats and other land cover types in intertidal environments, effectively improving the discrimination between coastal mudflats, salt marshes, mangroves, and muddy waters. Four typical coastal mudflat areas (i.e., the Yellow River Delta in Shandong, the Radial Sand Ridges of the South Yellow Sea in Jiangsu, Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang, and the Qinzhou Bay-Nanliu River Estuary in Guangxi) based on ZY1-02D were selected as the study areas. The extraction accuracies in the four study areas are 97.60\%, 96.88\%, 97.16\% and 96.97\%, respectively. The further extraction experiments were calculated based on hyperspectral data from GF-5, PRISMA, and Hyperion. Sample datasets were produced using field surveys and Google Earth high-resolution imagery. Compared to the Hyperspectral Bare Soil Index (HBSI), Normalized Difference Bare Soil Index (NDBSI) and Microphytobenthos Index (MPBI), MFI demonstrates superior performance with average SDI value improvements of 0.82, 0.71 and 1.17, respectively, in distinguishing mudflats from other typical land cover types in the intertidal zone. The extraction results were also compared with those derived from Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifications, showing that MFI outperformed SVM and RF by an average of 1.52\% and 0.58\%. The results show that MFI can be applied to different hyperspectral remote sensing images and different areas of mudflat extraction. The MFI-based method is simple, fast and accurate at extracting the mudflat in the intertidal environment. © 2024},

	abstract = {As two main primary producers in temperate intertidal regions, seagrass and microphytobenthos (MPB) support estuarine ecosystem functions in multiple ways including stabilizing food webs and regulating sediment resuspension among others. Monitoring estuary productivity at large scales can inform ecosystem scale responses to environmental stressors (climate change, pollution and habitat degradation). Here we use a case study to show how Sentinel-2 data can be used to estimate estuary-wide emerged and submerged gross primary productivity (GPP) on intertidal flats by coupling a new machine learning model to map seagrass and unvegetated habitats with literature-derived photosynthesis-irradiance (P – I) relationships. The model consisted of (1) supervised classification with random forest to delineate seagrass and unvegetated areas and (2) artificial neural network (ANN) regression to predict \% seagrass coverage. Our seagrass delineation by supervised classification had an overall accuracy of 0.96, while the ANN regression on seagrass coverage provided high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 0.11). The estimated GPP showed seagrass contributed slightly more to intertidal benthic productivity than MPB in the case-study estuary over the 3-year study period. This model can be used to predict the response of seagrass and MPB GPP to sea level rise, which shows that the future state may be very sensitive to increased turbidity. For example, by the year 2100, the model shows a sharp decline in productivity with sea level rise, assuming current turbidity trends, (loss of up to 52–53 \% for seagrass and 23–45 \% for MPB, a function of whether shoreward migration of seagrass is incorporated). However, GPP under conditions of unchanging turbidity (and no seagrass migration), exhibits minimal negative impact of sea level rise (loss of 3 \% for seagrass and increase of 29 \% for MPB). Therefore, controlling water turbidity might be an efficient solution to maintaining the current GPP as sea level rises. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Intertidal flats are frequently colonised by microphytobenthos (MPB) assemblages that form transient biofilms at the sediment surface which are responsible for large fractions of estuarine primary production. The large spatio-temporal variability in MPB biomass distribution in concert with the fact that tidal flats can cover many km2 makes the use of remote sensing particularly useful in assessing MPB distribution. Water content, sediment type and MPB vertical migration are variables that affect the relationship between ground truth measurements and remote sensing of benthic chlorophyll. The effect of chlorophyll depth distribution (top 2 mm) on the relationship between benthic chlorophyll and several remote sensing indices (NDVI, PI, R562/R647, derivative indices and PAM fluorescence) was investigated over a 2 year sampling period at 6 sites (Tagus estuary, Portugal). Additionally, the effect of the dark adaptation time required to measure the minimum fluorescence parameter (F0) was also tested. Sediment type strongly affected MPB depth distribution with muddy sites showing a strong negative exponential decay in chlorophyll with distance from the surface while sandy sites had a homogenous distribution over the same scale (2 mm). Chlorophyll content (mass per unit mass, μg g- 1) in the top 2 mm was better correlated with remote sensing indices than concentration (mass per unit volume, mg m- 3), both for NDVI (0.72 vs. 0.45) and for PAM fluorescence (0.70 vs. 0.55). Separating the data by transect increased the correlation values in all situations. A fitted model of chlorophyll depth distribution showed that the effect of asymmetrical chlorophyll depth distribution was stronger on the correlations between chlorophyll concentration and NDVI than on chlorophyll content and NDVI (0.46-2 mm vs. 0.74-125 μm, muddy site) the same was valid for fluorescence (0.66-2 mm vs. 0.92-125 μm, muddy site). Dark adapting the samples for more than 5 min did not result in any significant difference in the relationship between F0 and chlorophyll a. The residuals from the regression of chlorophyll content on NDVI were positively correlated (0.7) with the mass per unit of mass of sediment {\textless} 63 μm and negatively (- 0.6) with chlorophyll concentration, this indicates that if no correction is performed to account for chlorophyll depth distribution both units will be strongly affected by the mass of {\textless} 63 μm particles. The results demonstrate that although expressing chlorophyll a as concentration is generally a better option for ground truth measurements care should be taken to account for chlorophyll depth distribution since strong asymmetries within the sampling depth can introduce large errors. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB) are a major contributor to primary production in estuarine ecosystems. While their biomass is highly variable at multiple spatial and temporal scales, the underlying drivers are as yet little understood. Both in situ sampling and remote-sensing techniques often lack the temporal resolution or coverage to simultaneously capture short-term (intratidal to daily) and longer-term (weekly to annual) biomass changes. Our field setup with in-situ NDVI sensors allowed us to study MPB surface biomass variability at high temporal resolution (10 mins) for up to two years in a freshwater euglenoid dominated mudflat, and a brackish and a marine diatom dominated mudflat. MPB biomass showed marked periodicities at multiple temporal scales: seasonal, spring-neap and intratidal. The diatom-dominated MPB community showed a seasonal biomass peak in winter, while the euglenoid-dominated community showed biomass peaks during spring and summer, probably caused by underlying divergent responses to mainly irradiance, temperature and wind-induced resuspension, and macrobenthos grazing. Spring-neap periodicity likely resulted from differential migratory responses of the MPB communities to variation in timing and duration of daylight exposure. In the freshwater community, upward migration only occurred when exposure duration was sufficiently long (≥4 h). In the diatom-dominated community, morning daylight exposure resulted in highest NDVI values. This study highlights the differences in MPB biomass dynamics between MPB communities within estuarine ecosystems, and underscores the great potential of high-resolution temporal NDVI monitoring for more accurate estimates of MPB biomass and primary production. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We investigated which variables, including environmental variables and food availability, could predict the spatial distribution and dynamics of benthic macrofauna on an intertidal flat. A time series of macrobenthos and sediment grain size samples was complemented by time series of microphytobenthos and saltmarsh vegetation biomass and sediment grain size from airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, and elevation from laser altimetry. Response models were constructed to predict biomass and species richness of macrobenthos as a function of the environmental variables. Total biomass and species richness was best predicted by a combination of microphytobenthos biomass and sediment characteristics as explanatory variables. Deep deposit feeders and surface deposit feeders also responded best to a combination of variables, with deep deposit feeders responding more strongly to sediment grain size and surface deposit feeders responding more strongly to microphytobenthos biomass. The environmental conditions to reach maximum biomass differed for each macrobenthos species. Application of the response models to the remote sensingderived maps of the environmental variables enabled significant predictions of the spatial distribution of macrobenthos biomass, demonstrating the differences in distribution of the macrobenthos species. The. models also revealed the sensitivity of the macrobenthic community to environmental. change. In situ and remote sensing data demonstrated a significant fining of the sediment and a (temporal) increase in average microphytobenthos biomass. Field observations also showed a significant increase in species richness and changes in the relative abundance of species, with a decrease in Bathyporeia pilosa, and an increase in Nereis diversicolor, Pygospio elegans and Heteromastus filiformis. Such changes in macrobenthos biomass and species richness were indeed predicted from the response models. The study demonstrates that the synoptic remote sensing techniques combined with field sampling allow efficient ecological mapping and monitoring. © Inter-Research 2008 www.int-res.com.},

	abstract = {In intertidal sediments the presence of microphytobenthos in and on the surface affects the sediment biogeochemistry, can influence the flux of substances across the sediment interface and changes the physical surface structure and sediment stability. In this paper new methods of sampling and for examining the microphytobenthos assemblages of sediments have been implemented. This included the new Cryolander method for the fine scale (0.1 mm) sampling of intertidal sediments. Algal pigments in sediments were determined with a new HPLC method on a very fine-scale (μm) with depth. Such finely resolved pigment profiles are combined with electron micrographs of surface sediments to provide a new and radically altered understanding of the concentration of algal biomass in and on sediment surface layers. It is shown that benthic algal populations can be highly stratified in the top millimeters of sediments, with most of the algal biomass occurring in the top 200 μm (up to 700 μg chlorophyll a g-1). Therefore, in order to determine vertical algal distribution accurately, in all investigations where the absolute pigment concentrations at the surface of sediments are important, sediments should be sampled and analysed using microtechniques. This can prevent underestimation of chlorophyll at the surface of sediments of a factor as high as 6, as sediment sampling techniques based on cores with a depth of mm/cm can give results representing a dilution of the actual surface algal populations and even water contents. If the extent of this dilution is unknown, this can cause problems in algal estimations in general. Specifically, this is of great relevance to ground truth data for remote sensing and to diffusive boundary layer and porosity assumptions in biogeochemical considerations.},

The biomass of diatom within the surface sediments was estimated through field campaigns and the seasonal change in the spectral reflectance of the remotely sensed data was investigated. Field spectrum data were acquired monthly at the fixed locations for monitoring the microphytobenthos blooming and comparing with the spectral reflectance of satellite images. Sediments facies was also analyzed along with the spectral reflectance based on the in situ data, and the spectral characteristics of the area where microphytobenthos occupied was examined. A medium to low spatial resolution of satellite image was not suitable for the detection of the surface sediments changes in the study area due to its ambiguity of sediments facies boundary, but the seasonal changes of benthic distribution could be obviously detected. From this, we suggest that the study on the distribution of surface sedimentary facies and detailed ecological mapping in a tidal flat based upon the remote sensing images should consider the seasonal variations of microphytobenthos distribution which would be included in the spectral characteristics of the satellite images. © 2010 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Estuaries and coastal areas are highly important natural habitats, amongst the mostproductive marine ecosystems on earth. They provide vital ecosystem services tomankind and are particularly valuable as habitats and feeding grounds for a variety oforganisms, such as birds, shellfish, demersal fish and invertebrates, which often supportthe local economy. However, these ecosystems are under strong anthropogenic pressurecaused by intensive human exploitation (e.g. industry, fishery, tourism, domestic sewers).One of the major primary producing groups of these areas are microscopic algae thatinhabit intertidal sediments (microphytobenthos, MPB), even though their photosyntheticactivity is restricted to the narrow illuminated layer of surface sediment, where they formdense aggregates called biofilms. Microphytobenthic biomass often exceeds that of thephytoplankton in the overlying tidal waters. MPB provides an important energy sourcefor the estuarine food web, supplying up to 45\% of the organic resources of an estuary,and has a central role in moderating carbon flow in coastal sediments. Some relationshipshave also been established between the surface concentration of MPB and critical erosionshear-stresses, therefore providing important information about sediment erodability anddynamics in coastal areas. These vital ecosystem functions emphasize the need to detect and monitormicrophytobenthic biofilms accurately at the ecosystem scale. However, samplingintertidal flats is a complex, and frequently difficult, task. Intertidal sediments are oftendominated by small sediment particles ({\textless} 63 μm) forming large mudflats that are veryhard to navigate or walk. It is therefore almost impossible to monitor MPB spatialdynamics using regular field sampling. This has led to a growing interest in the use ofremote sensing techniques to detect microphytobenthic assemblages. MPB can exhibitconsiderable taxonomic and pigment variability, which is lost when chlorophyll a is usedas a single descriptor of the community. These different microalgae groups displaydifferent pigment compositions with specific absorption features, which can be capturedby hyperspectral sensors.In this chapter, we will first introduce the principles of imaging spectrometry (alsocalled hyperspectral remote sensing). Because of its high spectral resolution (from 1 to 35nm) and continuous sampling of the solar spectrum (more than 100 images acquiredcontiguously and simultaneously), imaging spectrometry can identify pigments based ontheir specific absorption features. We then present some algorithms developed to mapMPB in coastal areas. Analyzing the strength and shape of the specific absorptionfeatures leads to quantitative estimations of pigment concentration that would beimpossible to obtain from standard multispectral images. Finally, imaging spectrometryalso provides access to information at the subpixel level, dealing with the problem ofintimate (non-linear) versus areal (linear) mixtures. ©2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Salt marshes are one of the most productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecosystem services. However, they are seriously threatened by human activities and sea level rise. One of the main characteristics of this environment is the distribution of specialized plant species. The environmental conditions governing the distribution of this vegetation, as well as its variation over time and space, still need to be better understood. In this way, these ecosystems will be managed and protected more effectively. Low-altitude remote sensing techniques are excellent for rapidly assessing salt marsh vegetation coverage. By applying a high-resolution hyperspectral imaging system onboard a UAV (UAV-HS), this study aims to differentiate between plant species and determine their distribution in salt marshes, using the salt marshes of Cadiz Bay as a case study. Hyperspectral processing techniques were used to find the purest spectral signature of each species. Continuum removal and second derivative transformations of the original spectral signatures highlight species-specific spectral absorption features. Using these methods, it is possible to differentiate salt marsh plant species with adequate precision. The elevation range occupied by these species was also estimated. Two species of Sarcocornia spp. were identified on the Cadiz Bay salt marsh, along with a class for Sporobolus maritimus. An additional class represents the transition areas from low to medium marsh with different proportions of Sarcocornia spp. and S. maritimus. S. maritimus can be successfully distinguished from soil containing microphytobenthos. The final species distribution map has up to 96\% accuracy, with 43.5\% of the area occupied by medium marsh species (i.e., Sarcocornia spp.) in the 2.30–2.80 m elevation range, a 29\% transitional zone covering in 1.91–2.78 m, and 25\% covered by S. maritims (1.22–2.35 m). Basing a method to assess the vulnerability of the marsh to SLR scenarios on the relationship between elevation and species distribution would allow prioritizing areas for rehabilitation. UAV-HS techniques have the advantage of being easily customizable and easy to execute (e.g., following extreme events or taking regular measurements). The UAV-HS data is expected to improve our understanding of coastal ecosystem responses, as well as increase our capacity to detect small changes in plant species distribution through monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The richness of hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-collected signals makes possible quantitative inference by the inverse problem-solving of the chemical and biophysical parameters of the imaged object. In this article, we first propose a classification of the large variety of literature on invertible physics-based hyperspectral signature models by analyzing their founding hypotheses and methodologies. All the models found in the literature are based on the radiative transfer theory (RTT), but they are divided into three main branches. In the first one, the models rely on the Beer-Lambert law. In the second and the third ones, the models are based on Lommel's radiative transfer equation (RTE), which they simplify into a diffusion approximation equation or into a single- and multiple-scattering approximation equation, respectively. Thereafter, we present the most recent models available for each branch for applications in geoscience and remote sensing domains: MARMIT-1 and MARMIT-2 for soil, the Microphytobenthos Optical Model (MPBOM) for algae and bacteria biofilm, PROSPECT for plant leaves, Farrell for fruits and vegetables, and Hapke for solar system objects. On the one hand, this article provides an overview of the different works in the literature. On the other hand, it proposes a classification tree of the different models, allowing one to know the similarities and differences of the different models. Ultimately, the aim is to assist researchers in selecting an appropriate model based on their specific targeted application. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A new two-step microphytobenthos biomass mapping approach has been developed and applied to HySpex airborne images of an intertidal mudflat (Bourgneuf Bay, French Atlantic coast). The final aim was to discriminate microphytobenthic biofilms, formed on the sediment surface during diurnal low tide, and to estimate their biomass (mg Chi a.m-2). The approach was, first, tested on laboratory HySpex image of simulated biofilms of different biomass values. Estimated biomass values from reflectance spectra are in a very good accordance with those measured by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography). Application of model to HySpex images of the bay offers, therefore, an accurate biomass map of intertidal mudflat where any confusion between highly similar materials has been completely avoided. © 2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to field-based remote sensing of the spatial variation of chlorophyll (as an index of microphytobenthic biomass) in intertidal soft sediments using digital colour-infrared imagery. Variation in amounts of chlorophyll a was quantified from small (cm) to large (100 m) scales within a single tidal cycle, using levels of replication and resolution that would be difficult to achieve using conventional sampling strategies. Eight scales of interest were selected: 100, 50, 2 and 1 m, and 40, 8, 4 and {\textless}(4 and {\textless}2 cm) 2 cm. These scales have been associated with variability in chlorophyll in previous studies. The fully hierarchical design allowed spatial variance to be estimated independently at each chosen spatial scale. Data were collected along 2 replicate transects at 2 locations within each of 2 different estuaries. A strong linear relationship was found between measured chlorophyll and image estimates of chlorophyll. Replicate transects in 2 of the 4 locations showed similar patterns of variability across spatial scales. Relatively large amounts of variability were found at the smallest spatial scales (4 and {\textless}2 cm) and at the 40 cm scale, but the 8 cm scale was an unimportant source of variation. At some scales, transects gave similar results, providing generality to the conclusions reached. At other scales, transects gave quite different results, drawing attention to problems of inferring ecological processes when there are only single sets of data. Large differences in variability were also found from location to location. These patterns suggest that spatial variability is governed by complex interactions between fauna, microflora and sediment. © Inter-Research 2008.},

	abstract = {The invasion of the wild oyster Crassostrea gigas along the western European Atlantic coast has generated changes in the structure and functioning of intertidal ecosystems. Considered as an invasive species and a trophic competitor of the cultivated conspecific oyster, it is now seen as a resource by oyster farmers following recurrent mass summer mortalities of oyster spat since 2008. Spatial distribution maps of wild oyster reefs are required by local authorities to help define management strategies. In this work, visible-near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing was investigated to map two contrasted intertidal reef structures: clusters of vertical oysters building three-dimensional dense reefs in muddy areas and oysters growing horizontally creating large flat reefs in rocky areas. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with an ASD spectroradiometer, was used to run Spectral Angle Mapper classifications on airborne data obtained with an HySpex sensor (160 spectral bands) and SPOT satellite HRG multispectral data (3 spectral bands). With HySpex spectral/spatial resolution, horizontal oysters in the rocky area were correctly classified but the detection was less efficient for vertical oysters in muddy areas. Poor results were obtained with the multispectral image and from spatially or spectrally degraded HySpex data, it was clear that the spectral resolution was more important than the spatial resolution. In fact, there was a systematic mud deposition on shells of vertical oyster reefs explaining the misclassification of 30\% of pixels recognized as mud or microphytobenthos. Spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs were coupled with in situ biomass measurements to illustrate the interest of a remote sensing product to provide stock estimations of wild oyster reefs to be exploited by oyster producers. This work highlights the interest of developing remote sensing techniques for aquaculture applications in coastal areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The intertidal environments of estuaries represent critical exchange environments of sediment and sediment bound contaminants. Ecological and sedimentological related investigations of these environments require monitoring methods that provide rapid spatially representative data on sediment grain size distribution. Remote sensing has the potential to provide synoptic information of intertidal environments. Previous in situ and laboratory-based reflectance investigations have demonstrated that for effective quantification of sediment grain size distributions, remote sensing platforms must include measurements within the short-wave infrared (SWIR). In addition, the timing of image acquisition, in relation to tidal cycles and sediment moisture content, is critical in optimising the spectral differences between the coarser sand and finer 'mud' fraction of sediments. Daedalus 1268 Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) has been identified as an appropriate platform and sensor for providing accurate synoptic maps of estuarine sediment distributions. This paper presents the results from the application of ATM 1.75 m resolution data to the mapping of surface sediment grain-size distributions across intertidal areas of Ribble Estuary, Lancashire, UK. ATM imagery was acquired after the intertidal area was exposed to strong summer drying conditions. Pre-processing and linear unmixing of the imagery collected of the intertidal zone following a period of drying allowed accurate sub-pixel determinations (1.75 m resolution) of sediment clay (r2=0.79) but less accurate for sand (r2=0.60). The results also demonstrate deterioration in the image calibration with increasing sediment moisture content and microphytobenthos cover. However, recombining the subpixel end member abundances through multivariate regression analysis improved the image calibration significantly for both sediment clay and sand content (r2{\textgreater}0.8) for imagery collected in both dryer and wetter conditions. These results demonstrate that ATM data, or similar, can be used to gain quantitative information on intertidal sediment distributions and such data has application to a wide variety of estuarine research. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) are central to benthic tidal flat ecological networks. Large-scale information on total MPB biomass is difficult to obtain from traditional in-situ measurements. Here, we assessed the effectiveness of using surface sediment properties as proxies for predicting the total (depth-integrated) MPB biomass with Sentinel satellite data. First, the best subset regression was applied to the in-situ data to determine the properties that best predict the biomass decay rate with depth (sampling every cm up to 10 cm depth). Then, data from a controlled laboratory experiment were used to analyse the spectral response to different sediment properties (i.e., variations in sediment grain size, organic matter and water content). Subsequently, an algorithm was developed to obtain the spatial distribution of the sediment properties and the depth-integrated total MPB biomass from remote sensing data. Finally, we presented a case study in which the seasonal dynamics of total (depth-integrated) MPB biomass were obtained from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results showed that (1) the vertical distribution of MPB biomass on a tidal flat could be predicted by the surface MPB biomass, median grain-size (D50) and water content (W0) of the sediment (top 1 cm); (2) the near infrared (NIR) band absorption depth was a key feature in estimating D50 and W0; and (3) the seasonal variation in the total (depth-integrated) MPB biomass was prominent in Chongming Dongtan, Changjiang Estuary. We concluded that the depth-integrated exponential decay algorithm was useful for estimating total MPB biomass and, combined with mappable sediment-surface data, could help map the total MPB biomass in estuarine tidal flats at a large scale. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) from intertidal mudflats are key primary producers at the land-ocean interface. MPB can be more productive than phytoplankton and sustain both benthic and pelagic higher trophic levels. The objective of this study is to assess the contribution of light, mud temperature, and gastropod Peringia ulvae grazing pressure in shaping the seasonal MPB dynamics on the Brouage mudflat (NW France). We use a physical-biological coupled model applied to the sediment first centimetre for the year 2008. The simulated data compare to observations, including time-coincident remotely sensed and in situ data. The model suggests an MPB annual cycle characterised by a main spring bloom, a biomass depression in summer, and a moderate fall bloom. In early spring, simulated photosynthetic rates are high due to mud surface temperature (MST) values close to the MPB temperature optimum for photosynthesis and because increasing solar irradiance triggers the onset of the MPB spring bloom. Simulated peaks of high P. ulvae grazing (11 days during which ingestion rates exceed the primary production rate) mostly contribute to the decline of the MPB bloom along with the temperature limitation for MPB growth. In late spring-summer, the MPB biomass depression is due to the combined effect of thermo-inhibition and a moderate but sustained grazing pressure. The model ability to infer biotic and abiotic mechanisms driving the seasonal MPB dynamics could open the door to a new assessment of the export flux of biogenic matter from the coast to the open ocean and, more generally, of the contribution of productive intertidal biofilms to the coastal carbon cycle. © Author(s) 2018.},

Yet, the role of exogenous factors, and thus the effects of climate change, in regulating microphytobenthic biomass is poorly understood. We aimed to unravel the mechanisms structuring microphytobenthic biomass both within and across ecosystems. The spatiotemporal distribution of the biomass of intertidal benthic algae (dominated by diatoms) was estimated with an unprecedented spatial extent from time-series of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a 6-year period of daily Aqua MODIS 250-m images of seven temperate, mostly turbid, estuarine and coastal ecosystems. These NDVI time-series were related to meteorological and environmental conditions. Intertidal benthic algal biomass varied seasonally in all ecosystems, in parallel with meteorology and water quality. Seasonal variation was more pronounced in mud than in sand. Interannual variation in biomass was small, but synchronized year-to-year biomass fluctuations occurred in a number of disjointed ecosystems. Air temperature explained interannual fluctuations in biomass in a number of sites, but the synchrony was mainly driven by the wind/wave climate: high wind velocities reduced microphytobenthic biomass, either through increased resuspension or reduced emersion duration. Spatial variation in biomass was largely explained by emersion duration and mud content, both within and across ecosystems. The results imply that effects on microphytobenthic standing stock can be anticipated when the position in the tidal frame is altered, for example due to sea level rise. Increased storminess will also result in a large-scale decrease of biomass. © 2010 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) provides important ecosystem functions and services, contributing significantly to the total primary production in shallow coastal ecosystems. However, determining the factors that regulate the seasonal changes of MPB and its distribution patterns at larger scales is hindered by the considerable spatial and temporal variability in these environments. Here, we studied the dynamics of intertidal MPB biomass, cover, and net growth rates in a south European tidal flat (Cadiz Bay, Spain) over a four-year period using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Pixels dominated by different benthic communities (MPB, Zostera sp., Caulerpa sp. and green macroalgae) were identified at a 10-m resolution using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithm. MPB dominated the intertidal zone. MPB cover did not show a clear seasonal pattern and was clearly higher in the middle of the intertidal range of sea level. Despite interannual variability, MPB biomass was always higher during winter, coinciding with observations from other low latitude intertidal flats with temperate climate, and in the upper-middle intertidal. Net rates of MPB biomass change, calculated from the differences in MPB NDVI over time, showed maximal net growth rates from autumn to winter and maximum loss rates during spring and summer, although with high variability. Our study demonstrates that RF algorithms allow mapping MPB and other intertidal communities from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery accurately obtaining invaluable information from large areas at very high spatio-temporal resolution. The dissimilarities observed in the patterns of MPB variables over time or sea level, indicate differences in their ecological regulation, still largely unknown both here and in other temperate climate intertidal flats. High resolution remote sensing can aid in their detailed and systematic study producing a more integrated view of these systems and contributing to their science-based management and conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Authie estuary, located at the eastern part of the English Channel is of environmental, ecological, economic and societal importance. With the intention to better understand the sediment dynamic it is important to better assess the role of sediment dynamics including erosion, stabilization and sediment reworking processes which is challenging in such complex environment. It is also important to consider biogenic components such as the microphytobenthos (MPB) distribution, as the primary productivity may play an important role with the bio-stabilization process. As a consequence, there is a crucial need to provide a synoptic overview of inherent bio-physical characteristics of sediments (i.e., composition, water content, grain-size, and biomass) in estuarine environment by generating precise quantitative maps for predicting in a second step estuarine evolution by including sediment transport, sedimentation rates, coastal flows processes and sea level rise caused by climate change for instance. The use of the remote sensing technology is increasingly used for mapping estuarine and coastal environments by providing a synoptic overview of bio-physical characteristics of sediments. In that sense, the combination between remote sensing imaging, topographic data (LiDAR) and in situ measurements is suitable for improving our understanding of sediment dynamics with respect to physical and biological forcings. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the synergy between multispectral (i.e., SPOT 6–7 [1.5 m/pixel]; Sentinel-2, 10–60 m/pixel, 5–10 days)”, hyperspectral [Hyspex, 70 cm/pixel, 160 spectral bands] remote sensing images may be suitable for generating both reliable sedimentary and primary productivity budgets; at least for surficial sediments.

	abstract = {Phytoplankton is the major contributor to algal biomass and primary production of the North Sea, although crops of macroalgae can locally be up to 2000 g C.m-2 along the coast of the U.K. and Norway, and microphytobenthos dominates production in the shallow tidal flat areas bordering the coasts of England, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Data collected since 1932 during the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey show consistent patterns of geographical, seasonal and annual variation in the distribution of phytoplankton and its major taxonomic components. There is a trend of increased colouration in Recorder silks in the southern North Sea until approximately 1975 since when Colour levels (assumed to be indicative of algal biomass) have declined. In the eutrophic Dutch Wadden Sea the algal crop continued to increase; in Dutch coastal North Sea waters a trend of biomass increase reversed since 1984, apparently due to a reduction in Rhine river outflow. Long-term observations made at Helgoland since the 60's also show trends of increasing nutrients and phytoplankton biomass only to 1984. Adverse effects such as deoxygenation, foam formation and toxin production have been linked to mass concentrations of algae known as blooms. There is no evidence from existing reports for an increase in their frequency, although some years stand out with larger numbers. Occurrence of blooms can partly be explained by hydrographic conditions. More than 30 taxa are recognised as occurring in bloom proportions in the North Sea, approximately one third of which can be toxic. The crop of Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) is not likely to increase with eutrophication due to silicate limitation. An extensive subsurface maximum of armoured dinoflagellates, its abundance gouverned by hydrographic conditions, is the most characteristic feature of the central and northern North Sea in the summer months. Abundance, sometimes dominance, of picoplankton and of species that are not readily detected by microscopic observations has been documented by measurements of taxon-specific pigments such as chlorophyll b (green algae), alloxanthin (Cryptophyceae) and 19′ - hexanolyloxyfucoxanthin (Prymnesiophyceae or Haptophyceae). Analysis of time series of satellite images is a promising way to assess in a quantitative and, more important, synoptic way the patchy distribution of phytoplankton over large regions. Growth processes of the phytoplankton respond according to variables amenable to such satellite remote sensing. Empirical and theoretical relationships that can be established between chlorophyll a, 14C uptake, turbidity, stratification, suspended sediment type, irradiance and temperature in some well-investigated areas make remote sensing a potential tool to obtain reliable estimates of primary production in the whole North Sea. The 14C method for estimates of the rate of algal growth processes appears to agree reasonably well with other methods, both involving incubation of samples and in situ measurements of temporal changes of oxygen and pH. The level of net primary production is 250 g C.m-2.a-1 in the central North Sea, 150 to 200 g C.m-2.a-1 in the northern North Sea, and 200 g in the South. The main metabolic processes involved in phytoplankton growth have been modelled mathematically in terms of the most important controlling environmental parameters. Such parameters comprise not only those of a chemical signature (micro- and macronutrients, both inorganic and organic) but also physical effects of vertical mixing and sinking, and biological effects including allelopathic interactions, antibiotic excretions, vertical migration, and mortality due to grazing and parasitism. The balance between primary production and consumption of organic matter appears to vary both geographically and seasonally. The process of regeneration of primary products both in the water column and in and near the bottom seems to be of major importance. Future research should center around a study of growth-controlling parameters in laboratory culture experiments. The studies should include uptake of dissolved organic compounds by all taxonomic groups, including pico- and nanophytoplankton, and all aspects of ecosystem structure and function involving the relation between algae and microheterotrophs making up the small food web. There is a need to synthesize existing information on phytoplankton in the North Sea and the factors gouverning its growth, such as nutrients, river input and stratification intensity. Complicated inter-relationships and successional patterns between individual species which are limited by varying physiological requirements and adaptation to differing hydrographic regimes reemphasizes the importance of species identification in phytoplankton studies. Many future problems in phytoplankton research will not be resolved without accurate identification of algal species. Taxonomic expertise takes many years to acquire; there is at present a shortage of skills in this area and more resources should be turned towards training and long-term support. © 1990.},

Micro-benthic diatoms are abundant and a major primary product in the tidal flats. Fine grained upper tidal flats is considered to be the best conditions for microphythobenthos. A different type of microphytobenthos was found in coarse grained lower tidal flats. The newly reported microphytobenthos are algae and they began to exist after dike construction. A linear spectral unmixing (LSU) method was applied to the test data. The end-members were obtained by both spectral libraries built from field surveys and a remotely sensed image itself. End-members from spectral library were slightly more effective than those from image itself.

	abstract = {Quantifying temporal and spatial changes in microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass is critical for understanding its ecological function in estuarine food web networks and carbon flows. However, tidal fluctuations and the complex composition of coastal sediment limit remote sensing applications for estimating MPB biomass seasonal variations in estuarine tidal flats. We integrated radar Sentinel-1 (S1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S2) remote sensing data to quantify the temporal and spatial variability in MPB biomass in the Changjiang estuary, China. Pixels of water bodies on the tidal flats were removed by dynamic threshold segmentation of the water index with the combined S1 and S2 data, and salt marsh pixels were masked with the first red-edge band in the S2 data. We used the continuum-removed spectral absorption depth feature to construct a regression model for estimating MPB biomass with a regression coefficient of 0.81. The results showed that spectral absorption continuum removal methods using broadband multispectral data for MPB estimation are a promising alternative to hyperspectral narrowband ratio operation. Compared with the widely used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the scaled absorption depth feature was more stable for MPB estimation under a changeable sediment background. The produced seasonal map showed that the high biomass levels of the MPB in the study area are not limited to one season and one site, with an annual mean biomass of 14.39 mg chlorophyll a (Chl-a)·m−2 and 71\% confirmed accuracy. The highest biomass levels occurred in summer in the supratidal zone (19.51 mg Chl-a·m−2) and in spring in the intertidal zone (17.10 mg Chl-a·m−2) in the Changjiang estuary. The relative shore height, derived from the tidal range here, is an important variable that shapes the MPB spatial distribution. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating high-spatial-resolution (10 m) S1 and S2 data for future large-scale estimation of intertidal MPB. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

From this library of sprectra it was possible to create a procedure which enables a distinction to be made between different surface sediment types, the dominant phytobenthic species present on the tidal flats and to estimate the biomass of the microphytobenthos present based on the optical spectral signatures. Reflectance was measured in the optical window at 250 different sites in the German Wadden Sea. In parallel, pigment concentration of the microphytobenthos, grainsize and water content were also measured.

	abstract = {This study presents the results of field experiments that were designed to investigate the photophysiological characteristics of microphytobenthos (MPB) and to estimate primary production (PP) in Daebu mudflat, which is located at the west coast of Korea. A typical seasonal (or monthly) fluctuation of intertidal MPB PP was found in association with biotic (benthic Chl-a) and/or abiotic parameters (irradiance and temperature) over a period of three years. From a series of field-laboratory experiments using the oxygen micro-profiling method (totaling 28 surveys), three consistent phenomena were observed: 1) winter to early spring algal blooms, 2) seasonal changes in Q10, and 3) temperature dependent MPB photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I). In particular, both the chlorophyll-specific maximum photosynthetic capacity (Pbmax) and the saturated light intensity (Ik), derived from 126 P-I curves (1870 data sets of oxygen micro-profiling in the sediment), were significantly correlated with sediment temperature (p {\textless} 0.01). To develop an empirical MPB PP model, the relationships between P-I parameters and environmental variables were parameterized following established exponential forms (e.g., Q10). It was possible to estimate the MPB PP in Daebu mudflat area by using easily accessible explanatory factor, suitable to be used for future explorations of parameters such as sediment temperature, irradiance, chlorophyll concentration, and tidal height. The estimated annual MPB PP based on the empirical PP model were found to be greater than that in the Wadden Sea and average annual PP in the temperate zones of the world. Authors believe that the present approach of the MPB PP estimation could be combined with remote-sensing techniques (e.g., satellites) to support coastal ecosystem management. Temperature-based algorithms for photophysiological parameters were newly developed to improve the accuracy of estimating microphytobenthic production in an intertidal system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Processes operating on smaller scales however, such as the impact of benthic macrofauna on MPB development, to date remain underinvestigated. In this study, we analysed the influence of wild Crassostrea gigas oyster reefs on MPB biofilm development using multispectral RS. A 30-year time series (1985-2015) combining high-resolution (30m) Landsat and SPOT data was built in order to explore the relationship between C. gigas reefs and MPB spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Emphasis was placed on the analysis of a before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment designed to assess the effect of oyster killing on the surrounding MPB biofilms. Our RS data reveal that the presence of oyster reefs positively affects MPB biofilm development. Analysis of the historical time series first showed the presence of persistent, highly concentrated MPB patches around oyster reefs. This observation was supported by the BACI experiment which showed that killing the oysters (while leaving the physical reef structure, i.e. oyster shells, intact) negatively affected both MPB biofilm biomass and spatial stability around the reef. As such, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of nutrient input as an explanation for the MPB growth-promoting effect of oysters, whereby organic and inorganic matter released through oyster excretion and biodeposition stimulates MPB biomass accumulation. MPB also showed marked seasonal variations in biomass and patch shape, size and degree of aggregation around the oyster reefs. Seasonal variations in biomass, with higher NDVI during spring and autumn, were consistent with those observed on broader scales in other European mudflats. Our study provides the first multi-sensor RS satellite evidence of the promoting and structuring effect of oyster reefs on MPB biofilms. © Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Quantifying spatial variability in intertidal benthic productivity is necessary to guide management of estuaries and to understand estuarine ecological processes, including the amount of benthic organic carbon available for grazing, burial and transport to the pelagic zone. We developed a model to assess microphytobenthic (MPB) primary production using (1) remotely sensed information on MPB biomass and remotely sensed information on sediment mud content, (2) surface irradiance and ambient temperature (both from local meteorological observations), (3) directly-measured photosynthetic parameters and (4) a tidal model. MPB biomass was estimated using the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mud content was predicted using surface reflectance in the blue and near-infrared, both from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The photosynthetic capacity (maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to MPB chl-a) was estimated from ambient temperature, while photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter were derived from in situ fluorometry-based production measurements (PAM). The influence of tides (submergence by turbid water) on MPB production was accounted for in the model. The method was validated on several locations in two temperate tidal basins in the Netherlands (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Model based production rates (mg C m−2 h−1) matched well with an independent set of in situ (PAM) measurement based production rates (Oosterschelde: RMSE = 9.7, mean error = 1.5, χ = 0.57; Westerschelde: RMSE = 46.7, mean error = −17.6, χ = 0.9). The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature shows considerable variation and may be improved by using sediment surface temperature instead of ambient temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that emersion duration and mud content determine most of the variability in MPB production. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to derive a satellite remote sensing-based overview of average hourly and daily MPB primary production rates at the macro scale. As the proposed model is generic, the model can be applied to other tidal systems to assess spatial variability in MPB primary production at the macro scale after calibration at the site of interest. Model calibration, results and possible applications for regular monitoring of MPB production are discussed below. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Spatial and temporal variation in the spectral reflectance signal (400-900 nm) from the surface of an exposed intertidal mudflat was investigated in relation to the density and vertical position of microphytobenthos assemblages within the sediment. Spatial measurements were obtained from areas of sediment colonized by different assemblages of microphytobenthos (mainly mixtures of diatoms and euglenids). In addition, a station was selected to examine temporal changes in spectral reflectance (corrected for variations in ambient light) over an exposure period. It was shown that the spectral reflectance signal varied, depending on the pigment compliment and biomass of the surface assemblages of microphytobenthos. The qualitative variation in composition of the assemblages visualized by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy was confirmed by analysis of species composition (light microscopy) and by pigment fingerprinting (diode array high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). Time-series analysis showed that the migration of cells to the surface of the sediment during a daytime emersion period rapidly changed the optical properties of the sediment surface. Analysis of sediment pigment content was conducted using standard surface scrapes (0.5-cm depth) and a high resolution sectioning technique (200-μm layers). The migration influence was only detected by fine-scale analysis of pigments. This was demonstrated by a step-wise elimination analysis, which showed that correlations between the absorbance characteristics of the sediment and pigment content improved as premigration data were excluded. Maximum light penetration into the natural sediment was of the order of 2 mm under light conditions comparable with ambient levels. Two main conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) interpretation of spectral reflectance data must be consistent with knowledge of the ecology and behavior (cyclic migration patterns) of intertidal microphytobenthos, and (2) ground truthing of pigment-related signals from intertidal flats should be conducted on a scale relevant to the process of spectral reflectance from sediments. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

Eighteen intact sediment cores (i.d. 8 cm) were randomly sampled from a shallow microtidal brackish pond at Tjarno, on the west coast of Sweden, and were incubated in light and in darkness simulating in situ conditions. During incubation O2, inorganic N and SiO2 fluxes and denitrification rates (isotope pairing) were measured. Assuming mean values of 18 cores as best estimate of true average (BEA), the accuracy of O2, NH4+, NO3- and SiO2 fluxes calculated for an increasing number of subsamples was tested. At the investigated site, microalgae strongly influenced benthic O2, inorganic N and SiO 2 fluxes and coupled (Dn) and uncoupled (Dw) denitrification through their photosynthetic activity. In the shift between dark and light conditions NH4+ and SiO2 effluxes (∼0 and ∼110 μmol m-2 h-1) and D n (∼5 μmol m-2 h-1) dropped to zero, NO3- uptake (∼70 μmol m-2 h -1) showed a 30\% increase, while Dw (∼20 μmol m-2 h-1) showed an 80\% decrease. For O2 and NO3- dark fluxes, 4 core replicates were sufficient to obtain averages within 5-10\% of the best estimated mean, while 10-20\% accuracy was obtained with 4-12 replicates for SiO2 and {\textgreater} 10 replicates for NH4+ dark fluxes. Mean accuracy was considerably lower for all light incubations, probably due to the patchy distribution of the benthic microalgal community.},

	abstract = {Coastal vegetated ecosystems are major organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) sinks, but the mechanisms that regulate their spatial variability need to be better understood. Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17–32\%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45–35\%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48\%), but not POM (39\%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems. © 2019, The Author(s).},

A Lagrangian survey was performed monthly at five sampling stations defined by salinity (freshwater, 0.5, 5, 15 and 25) in order to collect zooplankton and measure the main environmental parameters (concentrations of suspended particulate matter, particulate organic carbon, chlorophyll a and phaeopigments). A combination of multivariate cluster analysis, species indicator index and canonical correspondence analysis was used to relate the spatio-temporal patterns of the zooplankton assemblages with environmental drivers. The estuary was divided into three different zones by means of environmental parameters while four zooplankton assemblages were identified along the salinity gradient. The Charente estuary appeared as one of the most turbid systems in Europe, with suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration reaching 3.5 g l-1 in the Maximum Turbidity Zone (MTZ). Algal heterotrophy and microphytobenthos resuspension from the wide mudflats could be responsible for the relatively high chlorophyll a concentrations measured within this MTZ. Salinity and SPM affected significantly the spatial distribution of zooplankton species while temperature and river flow seemed to control their temporal variations. From a zooplanktonic viewpoint, the highly turbid Charente estuary seemed to match an "ecotone-ecocline" model: the succession of species assemblages along the salinity gradient matched the concept of ecocline while the MTZ, which is a stressful narrow area, could be considered as an ecotone. Although such ecoclinal characteristics seemed to be a general feature of estuarine biocenoses, the ecotone could be more system-specific and biological compartment-specific. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were used to determine the ultimate autotrophic sources supporting production of three commercially important fish species over unvegetated mudflats in a subtropical estuary. Mean isotope values over the whole estuary for fish and autotroph sources were modeled to indicate feasible combinations of sources. Variability in isotope values among nine locations (separated by 3-10 km) was then used as a further test of the likelihood that sources were involved in fish nutrition. A positive spatial correlation between isotope values of a fish species and an autotroph indicates a substantial contribution from the autotroph. Spatial correlations were tested with a newly developed randomization procedure using differences between fish and autotroph values at each location, based on carbon and nitrogen isotopes combined in two-dimensional space. Both whole estuary modeling and spatial analysis showed that seagrass, epiphytic algae and particulate organic matter in the water column, including phytoplankton, are likely contributors to bream (Acanthopagrus australis) nutrition. However, spatial analysis also showed that mangroves were involved (up to 33\% contribution), despite a very low contribution from whole estuary modeling. Spatial analysis on sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) demonstrated the importance of two sources, mangroves (up to 25\%) and microalgae on the mudflats, considered unimportant based on whole estuary modeling. No spatial correlations were found between winter whiting (Sillago maculata) and autotrophs, either because fish moved among locations or relied on different autotrophs at different locations. Spatial correlations between consumer and source isotope values provide a useful analytical tool for identifying the role of autotrophs in foodwebs, and demonstrated here that both in situ production of microalgae and organic matter from adjacent habitats were important to fish over mudflats.},

Microphytobenthic biomass showed strong negative correlations with water column salinity and sediment redox potential, and a positive correlation with water column soluble reactive phosphorus concentration. Temporal variation in mouth condition, sediment structure and nutrient availability changed biomass and community structure but there was little spatial variability. During the quarterly sampling of this study, microphytobenthic biomass was higher during open mouth conditions (1.43 ± 0.14-3.64 ± 0.94 μg g-1 sediment) than under closed conditions (0.25 ± 0.08-1.88 ± 0.22 μg g-1 sediment). The estuary was sampled weekly immediately following a mouth breaching event, physico-chemical conditions and microphytobenthic biomass were measured. Biomass did not decrease following mouth breaching and ranged between 0.25 ± 0.02 and 0.56 ± 0.10 μg g-1 sediment.

	abstract = {We compared on eight dates during the ice-free period physicochemical properties and rates of phytoplankton and epipelic primary production in six arctic lakes dominated by soft bottom substrate. Lakes were classified as shallow (z̄ {\textless} 2.5 m), intermediate in depth (2.5 m {\textless} z̄ {\textless} 4.5 m), and deep (z̄ {\textgreater} 4.5 m), with each depth category represented by two lakes. Although shallow lakes circulated freely and intermediate and deep lakes stratified thermally for the entire summer, dissolved oxygen concentrations were always {\textgreater}70\% of saturation values. Soluble reactive phosphorus and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = NO3--N + NH4 +-N) were consistently below the detection limit (0.05 μmol l -1) in five lakes. However, one lake shallow lake (GTH 99) periodically showed elevated values of DIN (17 μmol l-1), total-P (0.29 μmol l-1), and total-N (33 μmol l-1), suggesting wind-generated sediment resuspension. Due to increased nutrient availability or entrainment of microphytobenthos, GTH 99 showed the highest average volume-based values of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chl a) and primary production, which for the six lakes ranged from 1.0 to 2.9 μg l-1 and 0.7-3.8 μmol C l-1 day-1. Overall, however, increased z̄ resulted in increased area-based values of phytoplankton chl a and primary production, with mean values for the three lake classes ranging from 3.6 to 6.1 mg chl a m-2 and 3.2-5.8 mmol C m-2 day-1. Average values of epipelic chl a ranged from 131 to 549 mg m-2 for the three depth classes, but levels were not significantly different due to high spatial variability. However, average epipelic primary production was significantly higher in shallow lakes (12.2 mmol C m-2 day-1) than in intermediate and deep lakes (3.4 and 2.4 mmol C m-2 day-1). Total primary production (6.7-15.4 mmol C m-2 day-1) and percent contribution of the epipelon (31-66\%) were inversely related to mean depth, such that values for both variables were significantly higher in shallow lakes than in intermediate or deep lakes. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Although phytoplankton biomass, community composition, and productivity are relatively well documented for these habitats, little is known about the community dynamics of BMA in these systems. We determined the community composition and seasonal abundance of BMA in the surface sediments of shallow (ca. 10–13 m) nearshore shelf waters off Charleston, SC. Our primary hypothesis was that BMA exhibit seasonality in abundance and, similarly, abundance is correlated with bottom water temperatures. BMA had a high spatial variability (CV = 20–50\%) over m to km scales. BMA biomass in the upper 1 cm of sediments exceeded phytoplankton by a factor of 3 and was composed primarily of diatoms with cyanobacteria and green microalgae (chlorophytes \& euglenophytes) as common, but relatively minor components. The BMA community exhibited a seasonal variation in abundance that was positively correlated with bottom water temperature. The highest abundances occurred in the summer months, peaking in August. This study is the first to report the monthly to annual spatiotemporal dynamics of BMA in the nearshore shelf waters of the South Atlantic Bight and offers insights in the potential contribution of BMA to shelf primary productivity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Assessing fluxes of matter and energy in food webs within and across benthic habitats is important to understand the ecological functioning in bays and estuaries, where the productivity is favoured by a wide diversity of primary producers. The temporal variability (March vs September 2019) in the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of primary food sources and benthic invertebrates consumers was investigated in a large intertidal area (Western English-Channel, France). The study area is influenced by megatidal conditions and characterised by salt marshes in the sheltered part, and seasonal Ulva spp. blooms. The spatio-temporal variability in the structure of the benthic food web was analysed at the scales of both the whole bay and the different assemblages, which constitute the mosaic of habitats. Inferences on potential sources fuelling the food web were supported by spatio-temporal patterns based on covariations and stable isotope trajectory analysis. Results highlighted that phytoplankton, microphytobenthos and SOM were, most likely, the main food sources. The trophic connectivity between salt marsh and benthic habitats within the bay was limited to some macrofauna species inhabiting muddy creeks within the salt marsh. Unexpectedly, the influence of Ulva spp. blooms appeared also limited. Spatial patterns illustrates the constancy of the spatial variability in the benthic pelagic coupling, with a higher influence of microphytobenthos in the upper shore compared to low shore assemblages. This first attempt to characterize intertidal benthic food web constitutes a relevant baseline for the conservation of the bay of Saint-Brieuc where a national Nature Reserve has been created in 1998 for the conservation of overwintering birds. The spatial and temporal patterns of the benthic food web observed in this study (1) confirm the importance to consider food web variability at spatial and temporal scales from sampling designs to data analysis, and (2) demonstrate the ability of the stable isotope trajectory analysis framework to highlight food web dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In Brazil, coastal upwelling is observed in 7 areas along the southeastern/southern region and is most pronounced near Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro. This region is exposed to moderate seasonal Ekman-driven upwelling that brings cold water with increased nutrient levels nearshore and is more frequent and intense during the austral spring and summer, primarily due to the prevalence of northeasterly winds. Our aim was to verify the influence of this upwelling on the benthic trophic structure of the inner and outer shelf off Cabo Frio through measurements of stable nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) isotopes. We identified 1 main pathway of organic matter (OM) transfer from the base to the top of the food web, as observed from the tendencies of the δ13C and δ15N values. The isotopic signatures of benthic consumers exhibited temporal and spatial variability, with no interaction between them. As the result of a time lag, only consumers (mostly decapod carnivores) appeared to reflect the assimilation of 15N-depleted and 13C-enriched OM produced and deposited during strong upwelling that occurred 4 mo earlier. Therefore, the intensity and period of the upwelling phenomenon were important for detecting upwelling in benthic food webs. Lighter nitrogen and heavier carbon isotopes were found on the inner shelf. Consumers may have exploited OM of different quality on the inner and outer shelf due to differences in sediment, hydrodynamics, mineralisation and assimilation of 13C-enriched microphytobenthos. Nevertheless, 4 trophic levels were estimated in the benthic communities of the continental shelf off the Cabo Frio upwelling system, independent of period or area. © Inter-Research 2014},

	abstract = {The broad spectrum of anthropogenic pressures on many of the world's coastal bays and estuaries rarely act in isolation, yet few studies have directly addressed the interactive effects of multiple pressures. Port Phillip Bay in southeastern Australia is a semi-enclosed bay in which nutrient management is a major concern. In recent years it has been heavily invaded by marine pests. We manipulated the density of one such invader, the European fanworm Sabella spallanzanii, and showed that it causes changes in the composition of macrofauna in the surrounding sediments, provides habitat for epibiota (both fauna and flora) on Sabella tubes, and reduces the biomass of microphytobenthos on the surrounding sediments. Of greatest concern, however, was the indirect impact on nutrient cycling. We suggest that the impacts on nutrient cycling are largely due to the feeding of Sabella and the epifauna on its tubes, capturing organic N before it reaches the sediment, excreting it back up into the water column as NH4, thereby bypassing sedimentary processes such as denitrification. Most notably, the efficiency of denitrification, the key ecosystem process that permanently removes N from the system, fell by 37-53 \% in the presence of Sabella. Importantly though, this study also demonstrated significant spatial variability in fauna, geochemistry and the magnitude of Sabella effects. Given that the effect of Sabella is also likely to vary in time and with changes in density, all of these sources of variability need to be considered when incorporating the effects of Sabella in nutrient management strategies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Yet such approaches are rarely applied to studies of lagoon or estuarine metabolism. Focusing on Bahía San Quintín, a heterotrophic seagrass-dominated lagoon on the Pacific coast of Baja California, México, we report on spatial patterns in surficial sediment CNS stable isotopic ratios as tracers of lagoon biogeochemical function. Stable nitrogen isotopes highlighted potential spatial variability in the balance between denitrification and nitrogen-fixation within the lagoon and identified an association between elevated δ15 N levels and oyster culture, suggesting that oyster presence may be enhancing N2 production. Spatial patterns in δ34 S covaried with sediment particle size, underlining the importance of sediment texture in determining the depth of sub-oxic-anoxic redox zones. Sediment carbon stable isotope ratios highlighted the lack of incorporation of seagrass carbon into seagrass meadow sediments, thus emphasizing the importance of phytoplankton or microphytobenthos for carbon accumulation in seagrass meadows. This report highlights the value of sediment isotopic values in corroborating spatial patterns in estuarine metabolism or macronutrient processing identified from chamber or flux-based studies. Stable isotope mapping can provide a useful addition to assessment of estuarine metabolism, or act as a stand-alone tool for generating hypotheses, identifying the influence of spatial gradients, and/or suggesting prime locations for investigation of microbial abundance or function. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos forms an important part of the diet of macrofauna (macrozoobenthos) in many intertidal ecosystems. It is unclear, however, whether the dependence of macrofauna on microphytobenthos varies spatially within and among tidal systems. We aim (1) to assess the spatial variability in the importance of microphytobenthos in the diet of macrofauna (i.e., between and within two tidal basins and as function of elevation), (2) to quantify grazing pressure of the macrofaunal community on different potential food sources (microphytobenthos, phytoplankton and terrestrial organic material) for several sites in two tidal basins and (3) to compare microphytobenthic production and summer/autumn grazing of the total macrofaunal community and grazing pressure per feeding type, with potential microphytobenthic production estimated from rates in early spring, when grazing was low. Using a natural stable isotope approach, we identified microphytobenthos as a more important food source for macrofauna than phytoplankton and terrestrial organic material. Microphytobenthos dependency differed between tidal basins for the genera Bathyporeia (sand digger shrimp), Macoma (Baltic tellin), and Peringia (mudsnail) and for sampled individuals of all genera combined, and did not vary as function of elevation. We showed that macrofaunal grazing on microphytobenthos is quantitatively important and, in some cases, approached microphytobenthic production rates in early spring. No positive relation between microphytobenthic production in early spring and macrofaunal grazing in summer/autumn was observed. This suggests that the studied consumer-resource interactions are coupled on a larger spatial scale (i.e., mesoscale, ≈10 to 100 km), rather than the fine (mm to m) scale. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Trophodynamic parameters have been used as input data for trophic models and are used as indicators to support ecosystem management decisions. To understand the ecosystems’ trophic structure and functioning, it is important to identify the major primary carbon sources within a food web. This study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal variability in isotopic composition of the basal sources of the food web of the Araçá Bay (23°49′S; 45°24′W) ecosystem. This site is a sheltered tidal flat and presents a sharp seasonal change in water temperature and salinity. Samples of 15 basal sources were analysed for δ13C (n = 187) and δ15N (n = 180) values and also for the C:N ratio, in January–March (austral summer) and June–July (austral winter) 2013, in the continental, intertidal (mangrove patches and soft and rocky bottoms) and sublittoral regions. The isotope values and C:N ratios were, in general, in the range of those available in previously published studies. C3 and C4 plants, green macroalgae and surface sediment organic matter (SSOM) did not present significant changes in the δ13C and δ15N values with time. For suspended particulate matter (SPM), microphytobenthos (MPB) and turf-forming algae, δ13C values were higher in the summer than in the winter; also in the summer, red macroalgae showed higher δ15N values. Spatial variability was investigated for SPM, SSOM and MPB. δ13C values were significantly higher for SSOM and MPB in the intertidal region than in the sublittoral but for SPM there was no difference among regions. Values of δ15N were higher for MPB in the intertidal region than in the sublittoral, and were higher for SPM in the sublittoral region than in the intertidal and continental regions. The δ13C associated to C:N values of SSOM indicated a coupling of the marine sublittoral region and the land organic matter of an adjacent island and the SPM δ15N variability pointed out a continental land-sea connection. Some mechanisms could explain the isotopic temporal and spatial shifts and sources of organic C in the study area: the seasonality of hydrodynamics and of phytoplankton size structures and biomass; the steady low concentration of nitrate and the episodic ammonia inputs; terrestrial runoff. Our results can contribute to the construction and understanding of a trophic model of the Araçá Bay ecosystem, and also for its management, considering the seasonal hydrodynamics, the coupling of marine sublittoral region in the São Sebastião channel and terrestrial organic matter from São Sebastião Island, as well as the continental land-sea connection.

Plant pigment biomarkers were used to monitor seasonal patterns in benthic microalgal abundance and composition across a PAH contamination gradient created by past produced-water pumping. The microphytobenthic community at Pass Fourchon was primarily composed of diatoms and cyanobacteria, as indicated by the carotenoid biomarkers fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively. Microphytobenthic abundance showed no consistent pattern of variation across stations or seasons; chlorophyll a concentrations generally ranged from 0·2 to 15·9 μg g dry sediment-1. Significantly higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were observed in porewaters at the highly contaminated (high PAHs) station; ammonium had the highest range (160 to 8500 μM at Station 1a). Higher DIN concentrations were likely due to rapid remineralization of microphytobenthic detritus at the highly contaminated station. Microphytobenthic response to enhanced DIN availability was likely hindered by PAH toxicity and/or macro- and meiobenthic grazing effects. In September of each study year, significant seasonal increases in total PAH concentration in surface sediments were observed at the contaminated site (Station 1a). Examination of PAH isomer ratios indicates this seasonal pattern was likely due to physical mixing events (i.e. storms) and not to changes in PAH inputs or preferential remineralization of certain PAHs.

	abstract = {Quantifying system-wide biogeochemical dynamics and ecosystem metabolism in estuaries is often attempted using a long-term continuous record at a single site or short-term records at multiple sites due to sampling limitations that preclude long-term monitoring. However, differences in the dominant primary producer at a given location (e.g., phytoplankton versus benthic producers) control diel variations in dissolved oxygen and associated ecosystem metabolism, and they may confound metabolic estimates that do not account for this variability. We hypothesize that even in shallow, well-mixed estuaries there is strong spatiotemporal variability in ecosystem metabolism due to benthic and water-column properties, as well as ensuing feedbacks to sediment resuspension, light attenuation, and primary production. We tested this hypothesis by measuring hydrodynamic properties, biogeochemical variables (fluorescent dissolved organic matter - fDOM, turbidity, chlorophyll a fluorescence, dissolved oxygen), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) over 1 year at 15\&thinsp;min intervals at paired channel (unvegetated) and shoal (vegetated by eelgrass) sites in Chincoteague Bay, Maryland-Virginia, USA, a shallow back-barrier estuary. Light attenuation (KdPAR) at all sites was dominated by turbidity from suspended sediment, with lower contributions from fDOM and chlorophyll a. However, there was significant seasonal variability in the resuspension-shear stress relationship on the vegetated shoals, but not in adjacent unvegetated channels. This indicated that KdPAR on the shoals was mediated by submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and possibly microphytobenthos presence in the summer, which reduced resuspension and therefore KdPAR. We also found that gross primary production (Pg) and KdPAR were significantly negatively correlated on the shoals and uncorrelated in the channels, indicating that Pg over the vegetated shoals is controlled by a feedback loop between benthic stabilization by SAV and/or microphytobenthos, sediment resuspension, and light availability. Metabolic estimates indicated substantial differences in net ecosystem metabolism between vegetated and unvegetated sites, with the former tending towards net autotrophy in the summer. Ongoing trends of SAV loss in this and other back-barrier estuaries suggest that these systems may also shift towards net heterotrophy, reducing their effectiveness as long-term carbon sinks. With regards to temporal variability, we found that varying sampling frequency between 15\&thinsp;min and 1\&thinsp;d resulted in comparable mean values of biogeochemical variables, but extreme values were missed by daily sampling. In fact, daily resampling minimized the variability between sites and falsely suggested spatial homogeneity in biogeochemistry, emphasizing the need for high-frequency sampling. This study confirms that properly quantifying ecosystem metabolism and associated biogeochemical variability requires characterization of the diverse estuarine environments, even in well-mixed systems, and demonstrates the deficiencies introduced by infrequent sampling to the interpretation of spatial variability. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, the spatial distribution of suspended microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in estuaries is poorly understood. In this study, the abundance of suspended microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in the water column was determined along the salinity gradient in Lake Furen, Japan, from April to October 2015. Throughout the study period, surface and bottom salinity changed horizontally from {\textless}10 to {\textgreater}30. Phytoplankton was the main contributor to spatial increases in total cell abundance in mesohaline water as a result of the lake’s hydrographic characteristics and water quality. The suspended microphytobenthos cell abundance in the surface and bottom water decreased with increasing salinity and was affected by the depth gradient. Suspended microphytobenthos cell abundances increased with depth (∼10 and 20\% of total cell abundance in the surface and bottom water, respectively), which indicated that they were derived from microphytobenthos on the seafloor. The dominant suspended microphytobenthos taxa (Cocconeis spp. and Melosira varians) were mainly distributed in oligoand mesohaline water, with peaks in mesohaline bottom water. In contrast, the dominant phytoplankton taxa (Skeletonema spp., Heterocapsa triquetra, and Prorocentrum spp.) were abundant at different salinity levels. The spatial distribution of dominant benthic and planktonic species in the water column was influenced by their tolerance to salinity. Our results suggest that suspended microphytobenthos contribute to microalgal communities in estuaries, especially those in bottom waters. Quantification of phytoplankton and suspended microphytobenthos will allow a better understanding of the effects of their spatial distribution on estuarine material circulation. © The Plankton Society of Japan.},

Ten sampling points along a 1-km transect were studied in a fringe area of the Solthörn tidal flat, southern North Sea, in order to determine seasonal differences in the microphytobenthos. An accompanying paper deals with the major component of the flora, the diatoms; here we, focus on the minor taxonomic groups. From May 2008 to May 2009 surface sediments were collected during low tide. Variation of environmental factors as well as microphytobenthic density (abundance and chlorophyll a) were monitored. The area investigated was a mixed-sediment mudflat, with a gradient from coarse to fine. Highest biomass was obtained in summer 2008 with 215.9 ± 12.6 mg chlorophyll a m-2. In late autumn the chlorophyll a concentration decreased continuously at all investigated stations. Lowest values were detected in December 2008. Species abundances varied considerably both along the transect and seasonally, depending on species-specific requirements as well as hydrodynamic conditions (tidal currents). Higher densities of benthic pro- and eukaryotic microalgae were observed in sites characterized by fine sediments. Apart from the diatoms, the most abundant microphytobenthic group was the cyanophytes. Coccoid cyanophytes, mainly Merismopedia sp., were most abundant during summer, with cell numbers up to 5.72 x 106 cells cm-2, while diatoms dominated in winter, spring and autumn. Filamentous cyanophytes, particularly Microcoleus chthonoplastes, were most abundant during autumn, while coccoid chlorophytes (spring: Chlorococcum submarinum, Crucigenia tetrapedia, Tetraselmis suecica), euglenophytes (summer: Euglena obtusa), dinophytes (autumn: Amphidinium operculatum, A. herdmanii) and cryptophytes (autumn: Hillea marina, Hemiselmis virescens) contributed to the microphytobenthos during warmer seasons. The statistical analysis confirmed that the composition of the microphytobenthos was related to sediment features and to characteristics of particular seasons. © 2012 British Phycological Society.},

	abstract = {Surface sediment properties related to cohesive sediment stability were measured over 8 consecutive day- and night-time emersion periods at three upper intertidal sites on a mudflat in August 2003, during the transition from spring to neap tides. Significant differences between day- and night-time critical erosion shear stress (τc) and chlorophyll a were found. A high degree of temporal and spatial variability existed between the sediment properties. During the first half of the study period, a rhythmic day-night variation occurred between τc, chl a, colloidal-S- and EDTA-extracted carbohydrate. During the second part of the study, the magnitude of variation of these parameters diminished. Results showed that sediments were more stable during the day than at night. Differences between day- and night-time sediment stability were related not only to diatom migration, but also to wave energy during preceding immersion periods. No significant relationships existed between τc and either chl a, or colloidal-S- or EDTA-extracted carbohydrate sediment content. It is suggested that tidal phasing, in terms of both the time during the day at which low water spring and neap tides occur, as well as the duration of the emersion period, control the biomass dynamics. The tidal phasing effect is expected to be more pronounced on a cohesive intertidal flat where low water spring tides occur at noon and midnight. The results of this study will be of use in time-dependent estuarine models. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The estuarine phytoplankton communities are known to respond rapidly to environmental changes, being considered an important water quality indicator; thus, it is crucial to fully understand its natural variability. The objective of the present study was to assess the spatial variability of both physicochemical variables and the phytoplankton community, to understand how such variability is influenced by seasonality and to evaluate how the anthropogenic sources affect such patterns. The Tagus estuary was used as a case study, since it is one of Europe’s largest estuaries, with high spatial and seasonal variations and a high level of human pressure associated with large urban and industrial areas. To achieve this goal, environmental parameters, nutrients concentration, bivalve biomass (filter feeders) and phytoplankton pigments were quantified in a single summer sampling campaign with high spatial resolution and in monthly campaigns in eight sampling stations through the Tagus estuary, in one year. In general, suspended particulate matter and nutrients decreased from the upper part of the estuary to the estuary mouth; however, relevant local inputs were also observed in more downstream locations, near outfalls of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The chlorophyll-a concentrations were higher over the southern intertidal mudflats, probably due to resuspension of microphytobenthos, associated with higher nutrient concentrations. Through a grazing indicator, it was observed that grazers are important drivers of variability of the phytoplankton community composition. All water bodies achieved “good” and “high” water quality classifications for both physicochemical and biological indicators, with the worst results reported for the water bodies located at the upper estuary. Therefore, this estuary presents a decreasing trend of nutrients and chlorophyll-a in the upstream–downstream direction, except for the estuary channels and the outfall in the northern margin, which lead to an increase in nutrient concentrations. However, these increases did not affect the water quality of the three analyzed water bodies, presenting at least good ecological status, considering the nutrient and chlorophyll-a indicators. © 2022 by the authors.},

Among them, suspension-feeders, like bivalve molluscs are widely used in trophic web studies. The main goal of this study was to investigate variations of C and N elemental and isotopic ratios in common bivalves (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and C. gigas) at large spatial (i.e. among three coastal regions) and different temporal (i.e. from seasonal to multi-decadal) scales in France, in order to identify potential general or specific patterns and speculate on their drivers. The observed spatial variability was related to the trophic status of the coastal regions (oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea versus meso- to eutrophic English Channel and Atlantic ocean), but not to ecosystem typology (estuaries, versus lagoons versus bays versus littoral systems). Furthermore, it highlighted local specificities in terms of the origin of the POM assimilated by bivalves (e.g., mainly continental POM vs. marine phytoplankton vs. microphytobenthic algae). Likewise, seasonal variability was related both to the reproduction cycle for C/N ratios of Mytilus spp. and to changes in trophic resources for δ13C of species located close to river mouth. Multi-decadal evolution exhibited shifts and trends for part of the 30-year series with decreases in δ13C and δ15N. Specifically, shifts appeared in the early 2000′s, likely linking bivalve isotopic ratios to a cascade of processes affected by local drivers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Spatial variation in light availability interacts with the physical dynamics of the water column to create predictable depth gradients in resources and disturbance that may differentially affect periphyton vs phytoplankton. We characterized the depth distribution of chlorophyll and productivity of periphyton on sediments (epipelon) and phytoplankton in the euphotic zones of 13 oligomesotrophic lakes that span a large size gradient (0.017-32,600 km 2). Epipelic chlorophyll usually increased with depth in the epilimnion. Light was the primary driver of the consistent within-lake patterns in periphyton productivity across this lake-size gradient. In 5 lakes, epipelic periphyton exhibited a unimodal distribution of productivity with depth in the photic zone, but no evidence of photoinhibition was found for periphyton. Rather, patterns in sediment N and P and observed changes in biofilm structure were consistent with determination of epipelic biomass by disturbance at depths ≤1 m in the smaller lakes and by light limitation at depths {\textgreater}1 m. Further quantification of the effects of disturbance on epipelon is needed. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that the perceived high spatial variability in periphyton biomass and productivity is not an impediment to development of robust models of whole-lake primary production that include both phytoplankton and periphyton. © 2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science.},

In this study we calculate the exergy, specific exergy and ascendency for the microbenthic loop that represents a major sub-system within the marine food chain. The analysis of the microbenthic loop investigated in terms of organic matter, bacteria, microphytobenthos and meiofauna reflected changes occurring in the trophic state of benthic ecosystems and provided a tool for comparison between different environments. Temporal and spatial variability of the holistic indicators were evaluated using benthic measures collected at different times for different environments in the Mediterranean Sea. Exergy was strongly correlated with the organic contents of the sediments, and did not provide a useful description of the investigated system. In contrast, specific exergy resulted related to the microbenthic loop structure and complexity while Ascendency mostly reflected its activity and organization. Temporal analysis showed that in natural ecosystems specific exergy and ascendency showed convergence and follow similar seasonal trends. On the contrary in strongly eutrophicated systems an uncoupling between the two indicators occurred indicating a malfunctioning of the microbenthic loop that become strongly dissipative.As a result specific exergy and ascendency calculated within the microbenthic loop appeared to be sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and trophic state and may be proposed as useful tools for the health assessment of marine benthic ecosystems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The high degree of physical factors in intertidal estuarine ecosystem increases material processing between benthic and pelagic compartments. In these ecosystems, microphytobenthos resuspension is a major phenomenon since its contribution to higher trophic levels can be highly significant. Understanding the sediment and associated microphytobenthos resuspension and its fate in the water column is indispensable for measuring the food available to benthic and pelagic food webs. To identify and hierarchize the physical/biological factors potentially involved in MPB resuspension, the entire intertidal area and surrounding water column of an estuarine ecosystem, the Bay des Veys, was sampled during ebb tide. A wide range of physical parameters (hydrodynamic regime, grain size of the sediment, and suspended matter) and biological parameters (flora and fauna assemblages, chlorophyll) were analyzed to characterize benthic-pelagic coupling at the bay scale. Samples were collected in two contrasted periods, spring and late summer, to assess the impact of forcing variables on benthic-pelagic coupling. A mapping approach using kriging interpolation enabled us to overlay benthic and pelagic maps of physical and biological variables, for both hydrological conditions and trophic indicators. Pelagic Chl a concentration was the best predictor explaining the suspension-feeders spatial distribution. Our results also suggest a perennial spatio-temporal structure of both benthic and pelagic compartments in the ecosystem, at least when the system is not imposed to intense wind, with MPB distribution controlled by both grain size and bathymetry. The benthic component appeared to control the pelagic one via resuspension phenomena at the scale of the bay. Co-inertia analysis showed closer benthic-pelagic coupling between the variables in spring. The higher MPB biomass observed in summer suggests a higher contribution to filter-feeders diets, indicating a higher resuspension effect in summer than in spring, in turn suggesting an important role of macrofauna bioturbation and filter feeding (Cerastoderma edule). © 2012 Ubertini et al.},

Despite a long history of ecological studies on rocky intertidal habitats, there is still a lack of basic knowledge about the microphytobenthic components. We investigated the spatio-temporal variability of microphytobenthos in the northwest Mediterranean at multiple scales, including both seasonal and daily observations, as well as its composition. Spatial variability of microphytobenthic biomass varied significantly with season, with an increase in small-scale variance from cold to warm periods. Furthermore, during warmer months, small-scale variances (tens to hundreds of centimeters) were larger than large-scale components (tens to thousands of meters). These results suggest large spatiotemporal variation in the processes driving variation in microphytobenthic assemblages, including interactive effects among stressful abiotic conditions, substratum topography and grazing. In addition, observed variability on a daily scale suggested that microphytobenthos at the study site (dominated by cyanobacteria) might cope with stressful environmental conditions through both physiological and behavioral strategies at micro-spatial scales, including small movements within the substratum. Additional research on ecological and physiological aspects of rocky shore microphytobenthos is needed to better understand its role within interaction webs and primary productivity processes. © The authors 2017.

Radionuclides of 210Po, 234U and 238U as well as 239+240Pu and 241Pu are strongly accumulated in Baltic organisms and plants and transferred through the trophic chain. The values of bioconcentration factor (BCF) in Baltic plants and animals are higher for polonium and plutonium in comparison with uranium. The principal source of radionuclides in the southern Baltic Sea is their inflow with rivers. Total annual runoff of polonium, uranium and plutonium from the Vistula and the Odra as well as the Pomeranian rivers were calculated at 95 GBq of 210Po, 750 GBq of 234+238U and 160 MBq of 238+239+240Pu. Seasonal and spatial variability of 210Po, 238U and 239+240Pu levels in the Vistula and the Odra drainage basins were assessed by application of neural-network based classification, especially cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and self-organizing maps (SOM). The result for the Vistula river indicated correlation between polonium and plutonium as well as polonium and uranium. In the Odra drainage basin, the biggest differences were observed in the case of 238U. To assess if there are statistically significant differences in mean concentration values of 210Po, 238U and 239+240Pu for the Vistula and the Odra rivers drainage basins were obtained by used of the non-parametric tests. Comparing to the Vistula catchment area, statistically differences concentration of 210Po and 239+240Pu in all year was observed for river samples collected on the Odra drainage basin.

There was no evidence of anthropogenic N-sources and SOM was mainly of autochthonous origin.

	abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) are an important, yet highly variable, component of productive shallow systems and intertidal areas. Samples were collected from Ria Formosa, Portugal, to assess the temporal and spatial variability of microphytobenthic chlorophyll in two types of intertidal sediment: mud and sand. Chlorophyll pigments were measured spectrophotometrically after freeze-drying and extraction into an acetone-water mixture. Time-series of superficial chlorophyll measured at two sites during 2006-2007 showed no obvious seasonal peaks. A truncated Fourier series was fitted to the time-series data. Seasonality was very weak: only 5\% of the estimated total variance could be explained by annual cycle components up to 3 year-1, while 25\% was explained by waves with periods from 14 to 91 days. The residual error of the Fourier series was partitioned into within-day variance (61\%) and other components (9\%). The within-day variation was made up of roughly equal contributions from: (i) variability associated with sampling within-sites; and (ii) differences between-sites. There were no significant correlations between MPB chlorophyll and tidal range, wind speed, solar irradiance, water temperature and salinity and water nutrient concentrations. Sediment type was once more confirmed to be a key factor to MPB spatial variability. These results are discussed in relation to processes controlling the distribution of benthic microalgae in Ria Formosa, and their implications considered in relation to on-going work to understand and model the role of microphytobenthos in eutrophication in such water bodies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A new ecotoxicological test system employing sand-living microalgal communities is presented. Equipment and procedures were developed for sampling and transportation of epipsammon to the laboratory where they can be kept and prepared for subsequent toxicity testing. The proposed test system make use of small-volume (60 μl) subsamples in the measurement of metabolic activities in short-term toxicity tests. The replicability is therefore very good and the variance between subsamples was shown to be low. After several hours of storage between sampling and analysis, epipsammon showed only minor changes in metabolic activities and no significant changes in sensitivity to the investigated toxicant tri-n-butyltin (TBT). The use of a community that has been established on a natural, but still homogenous, substratum has several advantages. Similar to other attached communities, but in contrast to phytoplankton, epipsammon represents a certain site and can thus have a known pollution history. The preparation and monitoring of sampling equipment for colonization of periphyton on artificial substrata is avoided. In addition, since epipsammon has been colonizing the sand for a long time, the community is also likely to be more natural than the opportunistic assemblages that are the early colonizers of artificial substrata. Epipsammon from the investigated locality also showed a fairly low spatial variability in most employed structural and functional parameters which indicated that the test system is robust and the actual sampling site not too critical. However, the estimated toxicity of TBT was shown to be lower to epipsammon than to previously investigated phytoplankton and periphyton. From indirect evidence, we suggest that this difference is not explained by different bioavailability of the toxicant in the short-term test systems but rather to the adaption of algae to natural environmental conditions in the sediments.},

Dietary reconstruction was based on the IsoSource mixing model, considering trophic enrichments of 3.5\% for carbon and 3.0\% for nitrogen, which were determined experimentally. δ13C and δ15N values, respectively, averaged -28.2 and 5.2 \% for riverine particulate organic matter (POM), -20.6 and 4.7 \% for inner bay phytoplankton, -21.0 and 5.6\% for outer bay phytoplankton, -16.8 and 4.8\% for micro- phytobenthos, -18.4 and 3.9\% for sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and 11.8 and 4.0\% for Zostera noltii. Clam muscle δ13C and δ15N values ranged from -20.5 to -16.4 \%, and from 7.6 to 9.3\%, respectively. δ15N significantly decreased from southern to northern parts of the bay, while δ13C values increased with tidal elevation. Outer bay phytoplankton was the major diet component of clams. Clams from the southeast mainly incorporated outer bay phytoplankton despite the proximity of the Leyre River, whereas clams from the northwest incorporated approximately equal parts of inner and outer bay phytoplankton, riverine POM, microphytobenthos and SOM. These patterns were consistent with spatial gradients driven by the dominant role of tidal hydrodynamics within the bay and land-use characteristics of the catchment. © Inter-Research 2009.},

	abstract = {Various remote sensing sensors observe the Earth’s surface at different spatial resolutions. In deriving surface parameters using remotely sensed data, the transportability of algorithms from one resolution to another is often of great concern because of the surface heterogeneity. This article addresses this scaling issue through image degradation experiments using a Landsat TM image. It is shown theoretically that scaling problems in deriving surface parameters exist not only because of the nonlinearity in the relationships between remote sensing measurements such as NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and SR (simple ratio) and the parameters of interest, but also because of the discontinuity between contrasting cover types within a mixed pixel. To quantify the effects of the nonlinearity and discontinuity on scaling, it is found that contextural parameters are more effective than textural parameters. Contexture-based functions are derived for the estimation of the scaling effects on leaf area index (LAI) calculations using algorithms based on NDVI and SR separately. Based on NDVI–LAI and SR–LAI relationships that were derived at the Landsat TM scale (30 m) as part of the Boreal Ecosystem–Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), the effects of scaling on the retrieval of LAI were investigated using nine selected areas of the same size (990 m×990 m) but different water area fractions. The following conclusions are drawn from the investigation: 1) Negative biases in the estimation of LAI occur when either the NDVI or SR algorithm derived at a fine resolution (Landsat TM) is used for calculations at a coarse resolution (for example, AVHRR). 2) The amount of the biases depends on the surface heterogeneity. For a pure forest pixel, the bias caused by the nonlinearity of the NDVI algorithm was smaller than 2\% and the linear SR algorithm induces no error in scaling. Therefore, the scaling problem for pure pixels may be ignored for many applications using either linear or nonlinear algorithms. 3) Large negative biases occur when a pixel contains interfaces between two or more contrasting surfaces. In the case of two contrasting surfaces between vegetation and open water, the biases can be up to 45\% of the correct value depending of the water area fraction in the pixel. The biases in this case depend on contexture and little on texture. Simulations show that the most useful contextural parameter for quantifying the scaling effects in vegetation–water mixed pixels is the water area fraction within each degraded pixel. Algorithms for remote sensing applications can be transported from one scale to another, if the information on the water body size is available. This study shows the need for global water masks at high resolutions for the purpose of accurate derivation of surface parameters maps at various resolutions. In boreal regions, this is particularly important because of the large number of small water bodies. Crown},

	abstract = {The correction of spatial scaling bias on the estimate of leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from remotely sensed data is an essential issue in quantitative remote sensing for vegetation monitoring. We analyzed three techniques, including Taylor’s theorem (TT), Wavelet-Fractal technique (WF), and Fractal theory (FT), for correcting the scaling bias of LAI with empirical models in different functions (i.e., power, exponential, logarithmic and polynomial) on both simulated data and a real dataset over a cropland site. The results demonstrated that the scaling bias became greater when the model non-linearity increased. The spatial heterogeneity, which was characterized by the class-specific proportion, the between-class spectral difference and the number of classes within each coarse pixel, was found to be the primary factor in the scaling effect. These factors influenced the scaling effect collectively and existed dependently. With the RMSE less than 0.3 × 10−6 m2/m2, TT was suggested for the correction with a polynomial LAI-NDVI functions. WF was preferred for neighboring scales rather than continuous scales. FT was not recommended for correcting the scaling bias caused by the significant non-linearity in LAI estimation models. This study illustrates the main causes of the scaling effect and provides a reference of technique selection for scaling bias correction to improve the application of remotely sensed estimates.},

	abstract = {Data across scales are required to monitor ecosystem responses to rapid warming in the Arctic and to interpret tundra greening trends. Here, we tested the correspondence among satellite- and drone-derived seasonal change in tundra greenness to identify optimal spatial scales for vegetation monitoring on Qikiqtaruk—Herschel Island in the Yukon Territory, Canada. We combined time-series of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multispectral drone imagery and satellite data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and MODIS) with ground-based observations for two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found high cross-season correspondence in plot mean greenness (drone-satellite Spearman's ρ 0.67–0.87) and pixel-by-pixel greenness (drone-satellite R2 0.58–0.69) for eight one-hectare plots, with drones capturing lower NDVI values relative to the satellites. We identified a plateau in the spatial variation of tundra greenness at distances of around half a metre in the plots, suggesting that these grain sizes are optimal for monitoring such variation in the two most common vegetation types on the island. We further observed a notable loss of seasonal variation in the spatial heterogeneity of landscape greenness (46.2\%–63.9\%) when aggregating from ultra-fine-grain drone pixels (approx. 0.05 m) to the size of medium-grain satellite pixels (10–30 m). Finally, seasonal changes in drone-derived greenness were highly correlated with measurements of leaf-growth in the ground-validation plots (mean Spearman's ρ 0.70). These findings indicate that multispectral drone measurements can capture temporal plant growth dynamics across tundra landscapes. Overall, our results demonstrate that novel technologies such as drone platforms and compact multispectral sensors allow us to study ecological systems at previously inaccessible scales and fill gaps in our understanding of tundra ecosystem processes. Capturing fine-scale variation across tundra landscapes will improve predictions of the ecological impacts and climate feedbacks of environmental change in the Arctic.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2015.06.001},
	abstract = {Abstract   MODIS has been providing daily imagery for retrieving land surface properties with a spatial resolution 250m since the year 2000. In many places, this pixel size is closer to that of individual landscape elements, such as managed forest stands or crop fields, than those of time series more typically used in vegetation analyses (with pixel sizes ranging from about 1km to 8km). With such spatial resolution, combined with its increasingly long archive, MODIS data offers great potential for vegetation monitoring applications in general, and crop growth monitoring in particular. However, due to its whiskbroom design, the observation geometry of the MODIS instrument, combined with the spatial uncertainty in the registration of the images, can result in different (albeit neighbouring) physical areas being mapped onto the same pixel depending on the view zenith angle (which varies from day to the next). Rather than considering this as an inconvenience, a method is here proposed to exploit this peculiarity to identify pixels corresponding to a homogeneous plant cover, in order to retrieve surface specific time series of satellite products. This method is based on quantifying the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, hereafter) of the daily MODIS NDVI time series, defined as the variance of smoothed temporal signal over the variance of the residues. If consecutive observations of the same pixel (which have thus sampled the spatial vicinity of that pixel) provide similar NDVI values, the resulting temporal signal is relatively stable and the SNR is high. Such stability can indicate that the signal comes from a spatially homogeneous surface, such as a single large field covered by the same crop with similar agro-management practices. On the contrary, a noisy time series indicates instead a transition zone between different land uses or between fields with different management practices. SNR maps therefore serve as a proxy for sub-pixel homogeneity from which time series originating from a specific land cover or land use can be retrieved. This approach is demonstrated over 12 contrasting agricultural landscapes across the globe from which clearly distinctive crop specific signals are extracted. Exploiting the full MODIS archive to derive surface specific information in this way should open new avenues for regional to global agricultural monitoring applications. Expanding this method to derive satellite products for specific land cover classes could also be useful for many other applications linked to dynamics of land cover and land use change.},
